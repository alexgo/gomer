It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, an issue of \"Array Index Out of Bounds\" was detected in the file `bind/bind.go`. This issue, if not addressed, could lead to application crashes and potential denial of service, impacting the reliability of the library.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with the project is moderate. The \"Array Index Out of Bounds\" issue is a common programming error that can be easily fixed. However, if left unaddressed, it could lead to serious consequences such as application crashes and potential denial of service. It is recommended to fix this issue promptly to reduce the risk.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: Customers using this library could face application crashes and potential denial of service if the identified issue is not fixed. This could lead to customer dissatisfaction and potential loss of business.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: Only one file was analyzed in the project and it was found to have a high-severity issue. This indicates that there may be other issues in the project that have not been detected. It is recommended to conduct a thorough code review and testing to identify and fix any other potential issues.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Based on the analysis of one file, 100% of the project files analyzed have issues of high severity. This indicates a high risk to the overall health of the project source. It is recommended to conduct a thorough code review and testing to ensure the overall health of the project.\n\nHighlights of the Analysis:\n\n- The project is a Go library focused on constraint handling and validation, following Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library.\n- An \"Array Index Out of Bounds\" issue was detected in the file `bind/bind.go`, which could lead to application crashes and potential denial of service.\n- The risk associated with the project is moderate, but could increase if the identified issue is not promptly fixed.\n- Customers using this library could face application crashes and potential denial of service if the identified issue is not fixed.\n- Based on the analysis of one file, 100% of the project files analyzed have issues of high severity, indicating a high risk to the overall health of the project source.",
