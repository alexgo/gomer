The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types.\n\nHowever, the analysis has identified several compliance issues related to GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and Data Privacy in the `bind/intool_test.go` file. These issues could potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access to personal data, and non-compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issues could have a significant impact on customers, especially those in industries where data protection is paramount. Unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data could lead to reputational damage, financial loss, and legal consequences for customers.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe `bind/intool_test.go` file appears to be the main source of the identified issues. The issues are of varying severity, with GDPR and Data Privacy issues being the most severe.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall health of the project source is concerning. The `bind/intool_test.go` file, which is the only file in the project, has several compliance issues. This means 100% of the project files have issues of varying severity.\n\n### Highlights\n\n- The project is a Go library that provides functionality for handling constraints and validations.
