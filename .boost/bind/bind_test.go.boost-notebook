The `bind` package is likely part of the `gomer` project, which seems to be a server-side application. \n\nThe code is importing the `testing` package, which is a standard package in Go for writing unit tests. It is also importing two custom packages, `assert` and `bind`, from the `gomer` project. \n\nThe `assert` package is typically used for making assertions in tests - checking that things are as they should be. The `bind` package, judging by the name and the usage in the test, seems to be related to data binding. This usually involves linking two data sources together and keeping them in sync.\n\nThe test function `TestCopyWithOptions` is testing the function `CopyConfigurationWithOptions` of the `bind` package.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the test function:\n\n1. `b1 := bind.NewConfiguration()` - This line is creating a new configuration object using the `NewConfiguration` function of the `bind` package. The resulting configuration object is stored in the `b1` variable.\n\n2. `b2 := bind.CopyConfigurationWithOptions(b1, bind.IncludeEmpty, bind.EmptyDirectiveIncludesField)` - This line is creating a copy of the `b1` configuration object using the `CopyConfigurationWithOptions` function of the `bind` package. The function also takes two additional parameters, `bind.IncludeEmpty` and `bind.EmptyDirectiveIncludesField`, which seem to be options that control how the copying is done. The copied configuration object is stored in the `b2` variable.\n\n3. `assert.NotEquals(t, b1, b2)` - This line is asserting that `b1` and `b2` are not the same. This is likely checking that the `CopyConfigurationWithOptions` function is correctly creating a new copy of the configuration object, rather than simply returning the same object.\n\nThe algorithm used in this code is quite straightforward - it's creating a new configuration object, copying it with certain options, and then asserting that the original and copied objects are not the same.\n\nHere are some resources for further learning:\n\n- [Go Testing package](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/)\n- [Go Test Functions](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/add-a-test)\n- [Data Binding in Go](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/#data) (this is not exactly the same as the `bind` package in this code, but it gives a good introduction to data binding in general)"
