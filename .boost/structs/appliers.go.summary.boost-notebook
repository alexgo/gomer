The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types.\n\nHowever, the analysis has identified several issues that could potentially impact the project's architecture, security, and overall health. \n\n#### Highlights:\n\n1. **Improper Access Control**: The most severe issue identified is in the file `structs/appliers.go`, where the function `ValueFromStruct()` uses reflection to call a method on 'sv' based on the 'source' input. This could potentially allow an attacker to call any method on 'sv', leading to unauthorized access or modification of data. This issue is of 'Warning' severity and could have significant implications for the security of the software.\n\n2. **Improper Input Validation and Information Disclosure**: These issues, both of 'Information' severity, were also found in the `structs/appliers.go` file. While these issues are less severe than the 'Warning' level issue, they still represent potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.\n\n3. **Improper Error Handling**: This 'Warning' severity issue in the `structs/appliers.go` file could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the software, potentially impacting the user experience or even leading to data loss or corruption.\n\n4. **Overall Project Health**: Only one file was analyzed, and it contained all the identified issues. This suggests that the project may have a high risk profile, as 100% of the analyzed files contained issues of varying severity. However, without analyzing the remaining files in the project, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment of the overall project health.\n\n5. **Potential Customer Impact**: The identified issues, particularly the improper access control issue, could potentially impact customers by compromising the security of their data. Additionally, the improper error handling issue could lead to software instability, negatively affecting the user experience.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project follows good architectural practices in terms of structure and separation of concerns, the identified issues represent significant risks that need to be addressed to ensure the security and reliability of the software. It is recommended that the project team prioritize fixing these issues, particularly the improper access control issue, to mitigate these risks.",

It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, there is a high-severity issue related to CPU usage in the file `structs/appliers.go`. This could potentially impact the performance of the library, especially if the function `ValueFromStruct` is called frequently or with complex data structures.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with this project is moderate. The main risk comes from the high CPU usage in `structs/appliers.go`. If not addressed, this could lead to performance issues, especially under heavy load or with complex data structures. However, the risk is mitigated by the fact that this is the only file with a high-severity issue.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: Customers using this library could experience performance issues if the high CPU usage issue is not addressed. This could be particularly problematic for customers using the library in performance-critical applications or with complex data structures.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The overall health of the project is good, with only one file (`structs/appliers.go`) having a high-severity issue. The other files in the project have no detected issues. However, the high CPU usage issue in `structs/appliers.go` should be addressed to ensure the performance and reliability of the library.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- There is a high-severity issue related to CPU usage in the file `structs/appliers.go`.\n- The risk associated with this project is moderate, mainly due to the high CPU usage issue in `structs/appliers.go`.\n- Customers using this library could experience performance issues if the high CPU usage issue is not addressed.\n- The overall health of the project is good, with only one file having a high-severity issue. The other files in the project have no detected issues.",

It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, the identified issues, particularly in the file `structs/appliers.go`, could potentially impact the overall architecture if not addressed.\n\n**Risk Analysis:**\n\n- The most severe issues identified are related to HIPAA, GDPR, and Data Privacy. These issues, if not addressed, could lead to non-compliance with these regulations, potentially resulting in legal and financial penalties.\n- The file `structs/appliers.go` has the highest number of issues, with 4 GDPR warnings, 3 HIPAA warnings, and 1 Data Privacy error. This indicates a high risk associated with this file and should be prioritized for remediation.\n\n**Potential Customer Impact:**\n\n- The identified issues could potentially impact the privacy and security of customer data. For example, the lack of data anonymization or pseudonymization could lead to exposure of personal data, violating GDPR regulations.\n- The error message in the 'Apply' function reveals too much system information, which could be exploited by an attacker, potentially impacting customer trust and satisfaction.\n\n**Overall Issues:**\n\n- The project has a total of 1 file, `structs/appliers.go`, which has several issues of varying severity. This indicates that 100% of the project files have issues, which is a significant concern.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\n- Given that all the project files have issues, the overall health of the project source is at risk. The severity of the issues ranges from Information to Error, with the most severe being Error. This suggests a high risk level for the project.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n1. **Architectural Consistency:** The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, the identified issues could potentially impact this consistency if not addressed.\n2. **Regulatory Compliance Risk:** The most severe issues identified are related to HIPAA, GDPR, and Data Privacy. These issues, if not addressed, could lead to non-compliance with these regulations, potentially resulting in legal and financial penalties.\n3. **Customer Impact:** The identified issues could potentially impact the privacy and security of customer data. This could lead to a loss of customer trust and satisfaction.\n4. **Project Health:** Given that all the project files have issues, the overall health of the project source is at risk. The severity of the issues ranges from Information to Error, with the most severe being Error. This suggests a high risk level for the project.\n5. **Risk Prioritization:** The file `structs/appliers.go` has the highest number of issues and should be prioritized for remediation.",
