It imports several packages including `fmt`, `reflect`, `regexp`, `strings`, and a custom package `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr`.\n\nThe function `ExpressionApplierProvider` is declared with three parameters: an unnamed parameter of type `reflect.Type`, `sf` of type `reflect.StructField`, and `directive` of type `string`. The function returns two values: an `Applier` interface and a `Gomerr` interface from the `gomerr` package.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:\n\n1. The function first checks if the `directive` is an empty string. If it is, the function immediately returns `nil` for both the `Applier` and `Gomerr` interfaces.\n\n2. It then checks if the second character of the `directive` is a dot (`.`). If it is, it returns a `StructApplier` with the `directive` as a parameter, and `nil` for the `Gomerr`.\n\n3. If the second character of the `directive` is not a dot, it calls the function `GetToolFunction` with the `directive` as a parameter. This function seems to be responsible for retrieving a tool function based on the `directive`.\n\n4. If `GetToolFunction` returns `nil`, it means the requested tool function was not found. In this case, the function returns `nil` for the `Applier` and a `Gomerr` error indicating that the field function was not found.\n\n5. If `GetToolFunction` does return a function, `ExpressionApplierProvider` returns this function as the `Applier` and `nil` for the `Gomerr`.\n\nThe function uses reflection, which is a powerful feature in Go that allows a program to inspect and manipulate its own structure and behavior at runtime. Reflection is used here to dynamically apply validation or other operations to struct fields based on the `directive` provided.\n\nFor more information about reflection in Go, you can refer to this article: [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection) from the official Go blog."

The function is designed to allow the caller to specify an alternative value to use when defining scoped configuration from the scope used during the application of a tool. \n\nThe function accepts two parameters: `alias` and `scope`, both of which are strings. The function doesn't return any value.\n\nHere is the detailed explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function first checks if the `scope` variable is an empty string. If it is, the function deletes the `alias` from the `scopeAliases` map and returns immediately. This suggests that `scopeAliases` is a map where the keys are aliases and the values are scopes. The `delete` function is a built-in function in Go that removes the entry from the map for the given key.\n\n2. If the `scope` is not an empty string, the function checks if the `alias` is already present in the `scopeAliases` map and if it is, whether its current value is different from the new `scope` value. If these conditions are met, the function panics with a formatted error message. This is done using the `panic` function, which is a built-in function in Go that stops the ordinary flow of a program and begins panicking. \n\n3. If the `alias` is not present in the `scopeAliases` map or its current value is the same as the new `scope` value, the function sets the `alias` in the `scopeAliases` map to the new `scope` value.\n\nThe algorithm used here is quite straightforward - it's basically a map manipulation algorithm, where the map is used as a dictionary to store key-value pairs and the function provides a way to add or remove entries from it.\n\nThis function is part of a larger system, and its purpose is to manage aliasing of scopes. This could be part of a configuration management system, where scopes are used to define different configuration contexts and aliases can be used to provide alternative names for these contexts.\n\nFor more information on Go maps and built-in functions, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go Maps in Action](https://go.dev/blog/maps)\n- [Built-in functions in Go](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/)"

The function is named `ScopeAliases` and it accepts a single argument: `aliasToScope`, which is a map where both keys and values are strings.\n\nThe function iterates over the `aliasToScope` map using a `for` loop. In each iteration, it extracts the key-value pair from the map. The key is referred to as `alias` and the value is referred to as `scope`. For each of these key-value pairs, it calls another function named `ScopeAlias` with `alias` and `scope` as arguments. \n\nThe `ScopeAlias` function is not defined in the provided code, but based on its usage, it can be inferred that it's a function that takes two string arguments and does something with them, possibly associating the alias with the scope in some way.\n\nThe algorithm employed in this code is a simple iteration over a map data structure. This is a common pattern in many programming languages and doesn't involve any complex algorithms.\n\nThe code is straightforward and seems to be consistent with general Go programming practices. It doesn't appear to conflict with any standard architectural guidelines. However, without additional context or information about the `ScopeAlias` function and the overall project, it's hard to provide a more detailed analysis.\n\nFor more information about Go maps and for loops, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go Maps in Action](https://go.dev/blog/maps)\n- [For statement in Go](https://golang.org/ref/spec#For_statements)"

The `applyScopes()` function is used to apply directives to a struct based on the scope. The function takes a string of directives, which are expected to be in a specific format: `[<scope>:]<tool_config>[;[<scope>:]<tool_config>]]*`. The function will apply the specified tool configuration to the fields in the struct that match the given scope.\n\n2. The function begins by creating an empty map of `Applier` objects, which will eventually be filled with the appropriate `Applier` for each scope found in the directive string.\n\n3. The function then uses a regular expression to parse the directive string and find all matches. For each match, it retrieves the scope and the directive for that scope.\n\n4. If a scope is not provided, it defaults to a wildcard scope, represented by `anyScope`. If the scope is an alias, it is replaced with the actual scope.\n\n5. The function then creates an `Applier` for the scope and directive. If an error occurs during this process, it is returned along with the scope as an attribute.\n\n6. If an `Applier` was successfully created, it is added to the map of `Applier` objects. If no `Applier` was created and the scope is not the wildcard scope, a `NoApplier` object is added to the map.\n\n7. Finally, the function returns the appropriate `Applier` based on the number of `Applier` objects in the map. If there are no `Applier` objects, it returns `nil`. If there is only one `Applier` and it is for the wildcard scope, it is returned directly. Otherwise, a `scopeSelect` object containing the map of `Applier` objects is returned.\n\nThis function is an example of the Strategy pattern, where different strategies (in this case, `Applier` objects) can be selected at runtime based on certain conditions (in this case, the scope).\n\nFor more information on Go's reflection package, you can refer to [Go's official documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/). For more information on regular expressions in Go, you can refer to [Go's regexp package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/)."

This struct has one field, `appliers`, which is a map where the keys are strings and the values are of type `Applier`. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n- `type`: This keyword is used to define a new type. In this case, we are defining a new struct type named `scopeSelect`.\n\n- `scopeSelect`: This is the name of the new struct type being defined.\n\n- `struct`: This keyword is used to define a struct. A struct in Go is a composite data type, which groups together zero or more values of different types. It's a way of creating a data structure that can hold different kinds of data.\n\n- `appliers`: This is the name of the field in the `scopeSelect` struct. Each instance of `scopeSelect` will have this field.\n\n- `map[string]Applier`: This is the type of the `appliers` field. It's a map where the keys are strings (`string`) and the values are of type `Applier`. A map in Go is a built-in associative data type that is used to store key-value pairs.\n\nThe `Applier` type is not defined in this code snippet, so it's not clear what it is. It could be a struct, an interface, or any other type in Go. It's likely defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n\nThis code does not contain any algorithms, it's just a type definition. \n\nAs far as architectural guidelines, this code seems to be consistent with typical Go practices. It's defining a struct with a map field, which is a common way of creating data structures in Go. \n\nI cannot provide any specific architectural conflicts without more context or guidelines.\n\nFor more information on structs and maps in Go, you could refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go - Structs](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/2)\n- [A Tour of Go - Maps](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/19)"

This struct is not shown in the code snippet, but it appears to be a part of a system that manages scopes in some way, possibly related to data validation or error handling. \n\nThe `Apply` method takes three arguments:\n\n1. `sv` of type `reflect.Value`: This is likely a source value that needs to be processed or validated.\n2. `fv` of type `reflect.Value`: This could be a field value where the source value needs to be applied.\n3. `tc` of type pointer to `ToolContext`: This is likely a context object that holds state or other data relevant to the current operation.\n\nThe `Apply` method returns a `gomerr.Gomerr`. `gomerr` is a package for error handling in Go. `Gomerr` is likely a custom error type defined in this package.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the method:\n\n1. It attempts to retrieve a scopedApplier from a map (`s.appliers`) using the current scope as the key (`tc.Scope()`).\n\n2. If it doesn't find a scopedApplier for the current scope (`ok` is false), it tries to get a default scopedApplier using a key `anyScope`.\n\n3. If it still doesn't find a scopedApplier (`ok` is still false), it returns `nil`, indicating no error.\n\n4. If it does find a scopedApplier (either for the current scope or the default one), it calls the `Apply` method on the scopedApplier with the same arguments that were passed in, and returns the result.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a simple map lookup with a fallback to a default value. This is a common pattern in Go when you want to handle a default case when a specific key is not found in a map.\n\nFor more information on Go maps, you can refer to the official Go documentation: [Go Maps in action](https://go.dev/blog/maps).\n\nFor more information on reflection in Go, which is used to handle the `reflect.Value` types, you can refer to: [The Laws of Reflection](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection).\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)."

It defines a function named `Composite` that checks for a composition directive in a string and, if found, creates a composed `Applier` based on the specified semantic. If there isn't a composition directive, the function returns `nil` for both `Applier` and `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The function `Composite` takes four parameters:\n   - `directive`: a string that presumably contains a composition directive (either '?' or '&').\n   - `tool`: a pointer to an object of type `Tool`.\n   - `st`: a `reflect.Type` object representing the static type of the struct.\n   - `sf`: a `reflect.StructField` object representing a field in the struct.\n\n2. The function first checks if the `directive` string starts with \"if(\" and ends with ')'. If it does, the function does nothing (as indicated by the TODO comment) and continues to the next step.\n\n3. The function then finds the index of the first occurrence of '?' or '&' in the `directive` string. If neither character is found, the function returns `nil` for both `Applier` and `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\n4. If '?' or '&' is found, the function splits the `directive` string into a left-hand side (lhs) and a right-hand side (rhs) based on the index of '?' or '&'. It then tries to apply scopes to both sides using the `applyScopes` function.\n\n5. If applying scopes to either side results in an error that isn't a `gomerr.ConfigurationError`, the function wraps the error in a `gomerr.Configuration` error with a message indicating that it was unable to process the directive.\n\n6. If there are errors from applying scopes to either side, or if both left and right `Applier` are `nil`, the function returns `nil` for `Applier` and the batched errors for `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\n7. The function then defines a test function `testFn` based on whether the composition directive is '?' or '&'. If it's '?', `testFn` returns true if the value is not zero. If it's '&', `testFn` always returns false.\n\n8. Finally, the function returns an `Applier` in the form of a `leftTestRightApplier` struct, which presumably tests a value using `testFn` and applies the left or right `Applier` based on the result of the test.\n\nThe function uses the `strings` and `reflect` packages from the Go standard library, and the `gomerr` package for error handling, which seems to be a custom package in the project.\n\nFor more information on reflection in Go, you can refer to this article: [The Laws of Reflection](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection).\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to this article: [Error handling and Go](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go)."

It is a method named `ifApplier` on a struct type `Tool`. This method returns two values, an `Applier` and a `Gomerr`.\n\nThe `ifApplier` method takes three parameters:\n\n- `st` of type `reflect.Type`: This is a type from the `reflect` package in Go, which represents the type of a Go object. Reflection in Go is a powerful feature that allows a program to manipulate objects with arbitrary types.\n\n- `sf` of type `reflect.StructField`: This is also from the `reflect` package and represents a field in a struct type.\n\n- `directive` of type `string`: This could be any string value.\n\nThe method returns two values:\n\n- An `Applier` which could be an interface or a struct type. Without more context, it's hard to say what this type does, but based on the name it likely has something to do with applying changes or operations.\n\n- A `Gomerr`: This is likely a custom error type from the `gomerr` package. The `gomerr` package is not part of the standard Go library, so it's probably a third-party package or something defined elsewhere in this project. Given the name, it's likely used for handling errors in a specific way.\n\nThe function body is currently empty (it immediately returns `nil, nil`), meaning it doesn't do anything at the moment.\n\nFor more information on reflection in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Go by Example: Reflection](https://gobyexample.com/reflection)\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)"

This struct is a data structure that contains four fields: `name`, `test`, `then`, and `orElse`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each field:\n\n1. `name`: This is a string field that likely represents the name of the `ifThenElseApplier` instance.\n\n2. `test`: This is a function field that takes a `reflect.Value` as an argument and returns a boolean value. `reflect.Value` is a struct from the `reflect` package in Go, which provides a way to inspect, modify and create any Go value. The `test` function will likely be used to perform some kind of condition check on a value.\n\n3. `then`: This is a field of type `Applier`. `Applier` is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it's likely to be an interface or a function type that is defined elsewhere in the codebase. The `then` field will likely be used to apply some kind of operation if the `test` function returns `true`.\n\n4. `orElse`: This is another field of type `Applier`, similar to the `then` field. It will likely be used to apply a different operation if the `test` function returns `false`.\n\nThe `ifThenElseApplier` struct seems to be implementing a form of the \"Strategy Pattern\", where you select an algorithm at runtime. In this case, the algorithm is either the `then` or `orElse` function, depending on the result of the `test` function.\n\nThis struct could be used to apply a different operation to a value based on some condition. The `test` function checks the condition, and then either the `then` or `orElse` function is applied to the value.\n\nFor more information on the Strategy Pattern, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Strategy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)\n- [Design patterns in Golang: Strategy](https://medium.com/@george.b.lopez/design-patterns-in-golang-strategy-57a4e3b1e0e0)\n\nFor more information on the `reflect` package in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Go by Example: Reflection](https://gobyexample.com/reflection)"

It's not possible to provide a complete analysis on this function as it's commented out and doesn't contain any logic. However, I can explain what the function could potentially do based on its signature.\n\nThe function is named `Apply` and it's a method of a struct or an interface named `ifThenElseApplier`. \n\nThe function takes three parameters:\n\n1. `sv`: This parameter is of type `reflect.Value`. The `reflect` package in Go provides a way to inspect the type and value of variables at runtime. `reflect.Value` represents the value of a variable.\n\n2. `fv`: This parameter is also of type `reflect.Value`. It seems like this function might be working with two different values that it needs to compare or manipulate in some way.\n\n3. `tc`: This parameter is a pointer to a `ToolContext` type. Without additional context, it's hard to say what `ToolContext` exactly is, but it's probably a struct or an interface that contains some context or configuration for the tool that's being used.\n\nThe function returns a value of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. `gomerr` is likely a package used for handling errors in this project. The `Gomerr` type is probably a custom error type that provides additional information about errors that can occur in this project.\n\nThe function itself is currently empty, as denoted by the `{}`. All the code inside the function has been commented out.\n\nIn terms of architectural guidelines, this function seems to follow common Go practices. It uses the `reflect` package for working with variables at runtime, and it uses a custom error type for handling errors, which can provide more flexibility and information than Go's built-in error type.\n\nFor more information on the topics mentioned, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection) (Go blog post about the `reflect` package)\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go) (Go blog post about error handling)"

The code snippet defines a new data type, `leftTestRightApplier`, which is a struct, Go's complex data type that groups together zero or more values of different types. \n\nThe `leftTestRightApplier` struct has four fields:\n\n1. `name`: This is a string field. In Go, a string is a sequence of characters with a definite length, used to represent text.\n\n2. `left`: This is of type `Applier`. `Applier` is not a built-in Go data type, so it must be a custom type defined elsewhere in your code. Without more context, it's hard to say exactly what `Applier` is, but by its name, it seems to be an interface or a struct that applies some operation.\n\n3. `test`: This is a function field. In Go, functions can be assigned to variables and passed around just like other values. This function takes a `reflect.Value` as input and returns a boolean. `reflect.Value` is a type from the `reflect` package in Go's standard library, which provides a way to inspect the type and value of variables at runtime. This `test` function presumably performs some kind of test on a `reflect.Value` and returns `true` or `false` based on the result.\n\n4. `right`: This is another `Applier` type field. \n\nThe `leftTestRightApplier` struct might be used to represent some kind of rule or operation that has a left side, a test, and a right side. Depending on the outcome of the test, different operations (represented by `Applier` instances) could be applied.\n\nWithout more context, it's hard to identify the specific algorithms used in this code, as it's just a data type definition. However, it's clear that this code uses concepts like data structuring, function passing, and runtime reflection, which are all key aspects of Go programming.\n\nFor more information on Go programming, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)\n- [Go by Example: Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)\n- [Go by Example: Functions](https://gobyexample.com/functions)\n- [Go by Example: Reflection](https://gobyexample.com/reflection)"

The purpose of this method is to apply some operations (represented by the `left` and `right` fields of the struct) to the provided values (`sv` and `fv`), and return an error if any operation fails.\n\nThe `leftTestRightApplier` struct has three fields:\n- `left`: a pointer to another applier that will be applied before the test.\n- `test`: a test function that will be executed if the `left` applier succeeds.\n- `right`: a pointer to another applier that will be applied after the test.\n\nThe `Apply` method works as follows:\n\n1. If the `left` applier is not `nil`, it is applied to `sv` and `fv`. If this operation fails (i.e., returns a non-nil error), the error is stored in `leftGe`.\n\n2. If `leftGe` is `nil` (i.e., the `left` applier succeeded or was not present) and the test function returns `true` when applied to `fv`, the method returns `nil`, indicating success.\n\n3. If the test function fails or the `left` applier fails, the method proceeds to the `right` applier. If the `right` applier is `nil`, the method returns `leftGe` (which may be `nil` if the `left` applier was not present).\n\n4. If the `right` applier is not `nil`, it is applied to `sv` and `fv`. If this operation fails, the method returns a batch error containing the error from the `right` applier and `leftGe` (which may be `nil`).\n\n5. If the `right` applier succeeds but `leftGe` is not `nil` (i.e., the `left` applier failed but the `right` applier succeeded), a message is printed to the console. This is likely for debugging purposes, as indicated by the `TODO` comment.\n\n6. Finally, if the `right` applier succeeds and `leftGe` is `nil`, the method returns `nil`, indicating success.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a form of sequential processing, where each operation is applied in a specific order and the next operation depends on the success of the previous one. This is a common pattern in Go, especially in error handling.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Errors are values](https://blog.golang.org/errors-are-values)\n- [Working with Errors in Go 1.13](https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors)"
