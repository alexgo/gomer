The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. \n\nKey Highlights:\n\n1. **Issue Severity and Impact**: The most severe issue identified in the project is a warning related to potential data exposure in the file `gomerr/unprocessable.go`. This issue could lead to exposure of sensitive data if not addressed, posing a risk to the security and privacy of the software's users.\n\n2. **Risk Assessment**: The risk associated with the identified issue is moderate. While the potential for data exposure is a serious concern, the issue is localized to a single file and does not appear to be systemic throughout the project. \n\n3. **Customer Impact**: If left unaddressed, the identified issue could lead to a breach of user data, which would significantly impact customer trust and could potentially lead to legal and regulatory consequences. \n\n4. **Project Health**: The project appears to be in good health overall, with only one file out of the total having identified issues. This represents a small percentage of the total project files, suggesting that the codebase is generally well-structured and adheres to good programming practices.\n\n5. **Architectural Consistency**: The project does not have any additional special architectural guidelines or constraints, and the code appears to be consistent with general best practices for Go libraries. The identified issue does not seem to stem from a violation of architectural principles, but rather from a specific implementation detail.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project is generally well-structured and adheres to good programming practices, the identified data exposure issue needs to be addressed to ensure the security and privacy of the software's users. The issue appears to be localized and not systemic, suggesting that it can be resolved without significant architectural changes.",
