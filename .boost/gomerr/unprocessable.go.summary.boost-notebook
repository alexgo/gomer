The project is written in Go and follows a modular and structured approach, which is consistent with best practices for Go server applications.\n\nHowever, there are some areas of concern that need to be addressed to ensure the overall health and security of the project. \n\n#### Highlights of the Analysis\n\n1. **Data Exposure Risk**: The most severe issue found in the project is related to potential data exposure. The file `gomerr/unprocessable.go` has a struct 'UnprocessableError' that includes its type during error reporting. This could potentially lead to exposure of sensitive data if the value contains such information. This issue is categorized as a 'Warning' severity level, indicating a significant risk that needs immediate attention.\n\n2. **Percentage of Files with Issues**: Based on the analysis, only one file has been identified with issues out of the total project files. This suggests that the majority of the project files are free from detected issues. However, the severity of the issue found in the `gomerr/unprocessable.go` file warrants immediate attention.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The potential data exposure issue could have a significant impact on customers if sensitive data is exposed. This could lead to a loss of trust and potential legal implications. It is recommended to address this issue promptly to mitigate any potential customer impact.\n\n4. **Overall Project Health**: Despite the data exposure issue, the overall health of the project appears to be good. The project follows a modular and structured approach, with a focus on data validation and error handling. However, the data exposure issue needs to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the project.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: The risk associated with the data exposure issue is high due to the potential for sensitive data exposure. However, since this issue is confined to a single file, the overall risk to the project is moderate. It is recommended to address this issue promptly to reduce the risk level.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for Go server applications, the data exposure issue presents a significant risk that needs to be addressed. It is recommended to review the 'UnprocessableError' struct and implement a custom error formatting method that excludes sensitive data to mitigate this risk.",
