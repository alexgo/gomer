This is a common pattern in Go when you need to provide more context or additional fields in your errors.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n- `package gomerr`: This line defines the package name as `gomerr`. All the files in the same directory should declare the same package name. \n\n- `type ConfigurationError struct`: This line starts the definition of a new struct type named `ConfigurationError`. In Go, a struct is a composite data type that groups together zero or more values of different types. You can think of it as a blueprint for creating more complex data types.\n\n- `Gomerr`: This is an embedded field of type `Gomerr` in the `ConfigurationError` struct. The `Gomerr` type isn't defined in this code snippet, so it's likely defined elsewhere in the `gomerr` package. When a struct embeds another type, the embedded type's fields or methods can be accessed directly on the embedding struct, as if they were declared on the embedding struct itself.\n\n- `Problem string`: This line declares a field named `Problem` of type `string` in the `ConfigurationError` struct. This field can be used to provide a more detailed description of the configuration error.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the `ConfigurationError` type:\n\n```go\nfunc LoadConfig(path string) (*Config, error) {\n\t// If there's a problem loading the configuration file...\n\treturn nil, &gomerr.ConfigurationError{\n\t\tProblem: \"Failed to load configuration file\",\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn the caller function, you can type-assert the error to a `*gomerr.ConfigurationError` to access the `Problem` field:\n\n```go\nconfig, err := LoadConfig(\"/path/to/config\")\nif err != nil {\n\tif configErr, ok := err.(*gomerr.ConfigurationError); ok {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Configuration error:\", configErr.Problem)\n\t}\n\treturn\n}\n```\n\nThis code doesn't seem to use any specific algorithms, but it does use the concept of custom error types, which is a common pattern in Go for providing more context with your errors.\n\nFor more information about errors in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)."

This function takes a string argument `problem` and returns a pointer to a `ConfigurationError` struct. \n\nThe function body calls a `Build` function, which is not defined in this code snippet, but presumably exists elsewhere in the project. The `Build` function takes two arguments: a new instance of `ConfigurationError` and the `problem` string. \n\nThe `new` keyword in Go is used to allocate memory for a value of a certain type and return a pointer to that value. In this case, `new(ConfigurationError)` creates a new instance of `ConfigurationError` and returns a pointer to it. This pointer is then passed as the first argument to the `Build` function.\n\nThe `Build` function presumably constructs or builds a `ConfigurationError` instance based on the provided `problem` string. The `.(*ConfigurationError)` operation is a type assertion in Go, which asserts that the result of the `Build` function is a pointer to a `ConfigurationError`.\n\nThe purpose of this function is likely to create and return a `ConfigurationError` with certain properties or state based on the `problem` string. \n\nThis function could be part of a larger error handling strategy in the application, where different types of errors are represented by different structs, and there are specific functions for creating instances of each error type.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Errors - The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/pkg/errors/)"
