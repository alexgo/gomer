The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. \n\nHowever, the analysis has identified a potential data compliance issue in the `gomerr/unmarshal.go` file. This issue could have a significant impact on the overall project, particularly in terms of data compliance and security.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issue could potentially lead to a data breach if personal data is logged or displayed without proper data sanitization. This could have serious implications for customers, including loss of trust, potential legal implications, and damage to the company's reputation.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe analysis identified a total of 1 file with issues out of 1 file analyzed. This means that 100% of the project files have issues, all of which are of warning severity.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nGiven that all the files analyzed have issues, the overall health of the project source is concerning. The identified issues are of warning severity, indicating a potential risk if not addressed.\n\n### Highlights of the Analysis\n\n1. **Architectural Soundness:** The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types.\n2. **Data Compliance Issue:** The `gomerr/unmarshal.go` file has a potential data compliance issue related to GDPR and HIPAA. This issue could potentially lead to a data breach if personal data is logged or displayed without proper data sanitization.\n3. **Potential Customer Impact:** The identified issue could have serious implications for customers, including loss of trust, potential legal implications, and damage to the company's reputation.\n4. **Risk Assessment:** Given that all the files analyzed have issues, the overall health of the project source is concerning. The identified issues are of warning severity, indicating a potential risk if not addressed.\n5. **No Additional Architectural Guidelines:** The software project has no additional special architectural guidelines or constraints, which means that the project is free to follow the best practices and principles of the Go language and software development in general.",
