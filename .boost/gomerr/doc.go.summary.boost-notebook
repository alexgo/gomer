The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. \n\nHowever, the analysis has identified a potential issue in the `gomerr/doc.go` file that could impact the project's memory usage. This issue is categorized as a warning, indicating a potential risk that needs to be addressed.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issue could potentially lead to excessive memory usage if a large number of errors are generated, each including a stack trace and other metadata. This could impact the performance of applications using this library, particularly in high-load scenarios. \n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe analysis has identified one warning issue related to memory usage in the `gomerr/doc.go` file. No other issues were identified in the project files.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nGiven that only one file was analyzed and it contains a warning issue, the risk to the overall health of the project source is moderate. However, the potential impact on memory usage could be significant, particularly in high-load scenarios.\n\n### Highlights\n\n1. **Architectural Soundness**: The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types.\n\n2. **Potential Memory Usage Issue**: The `gomerr/doc.go` file has a warning issue related to potential excessive memory usage. This could impact the performance of applications using this library, particularly in high-load scenarios.\n\n3. **Risk Level**: Given that only one file was analyzed and it contains a warning issue, the risk to the overall health of the project source is moderate.\n\n4. **Customer Impact**: The potential memory usage issue could impact the performance of applications using this library, which could in turn impact the end-user experience.\n\n5. **No Additional Architectural Guidelines**: The project does not have any additional special architectural guidelines or constraints, which provides flexibility in addressing the identified issue.",

The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. \n\nHowever, the project has some potential compliance issues related to GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. These issues are found in the file `gomerr/doc.go`, which appears to be part of an error handling package that may capture error details. This could include personal data, which could be a violation of GDPR if sensitive data is logged and stored without proper consent and protection. Similarly, if the application processes, stores, or transmits cardholder data and it logs error details that may contain cardholder data, it can be a violation of PCI DSS requirements.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe potential customer impact of these issues is significant. If the library is used in applications that handle sensitive personal data or cardholder data, it could lead to compliance violations and potential fines. It could also lead to a loss of trust from customers if their data is not handled securely.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe overall issues in the project are related to data compliance. The project needs to ensure that personal data is not logged or, if it must be logged for debugging purposes, that it is anonymized or pseudonymized. Also, the project needs to ensure that data is stored securely and that the user has given consent for their data to be used in this way.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nBased on the analysis, the risk to the overall health of the project source is moderate. The project has one file, `gomerr/doc.go`, which has been flagged with compliance issues. This represents 100% of the project files. However, the issues are warnings, not errors, indicating that they are potential problems that should be addressed but do not necessarily indicate a failure of the project.\n\n### Highlights\n\n- The project is a well-structured Go library focusing on constraint handling and validation.\n- The project has potential GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance issues related to the handling of personal and cardholder data.\n- These issues are found in the file `gomerr/doc.go`, which is part of an error handling package.\n- The potential customer impact of these issues is significant, as they could lead to compliance violations and a loss of trust.\n- The overall risk to the project is moderate, with 100% of the project files flagged with warnings related to data compliance.",
