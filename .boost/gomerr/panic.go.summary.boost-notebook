It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. However, there is a potential architectural risk in the `Panic()` function in the `gomerr/panic.go` file, which could potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting system resources.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with the `Panic()` function is high, as it could potentially lead to a system crash if an attacker controls the 'recover' interface and sends a large amount of data. This could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption, commonly known as 'Resource Exhaustion'. The risk is further increased by the fact that this is a library, which could be used in multiple other projects, amplifying the potential impact.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: If left unaddressed, this issue could lead to service disruptions for customers using applications built with this library. This could result in customer dissatisfaction, potential loss of business, and damage to the company's reputation.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has one file, `gomerr/panic.go`, with a high-severity issue. This represents 100% of the project files, indicating a significant issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\n- **Overall Health**: The overall health of the project source is concerning, given that 100% of the project files have a high-severity issue. This indicates a need for immediate attention and remediation.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- The `Panic()` function in the `gomerr/panic.go` file presents a high risk of a potential DoS attack by exhausting system resources.\n- The potential customer impact is high, as this issue could lead to service disruptions for customers using applications built with this library.\n- 100% of the project files have a high-severity issue, indicating a significant issue that needs to be addressed.\n- The overall health of the project source is concerning and requires immediate attention and remediation.",

The project appears to be well-structured and follows Go's idiomatic style for a library. However, there are some potential issues that could impact the project's overall health and its customers.\n\n1. **Data Privacy Concerns**: The most severe issue found in the project is related to data privacy. The 'PanicError' struct in the 'gomerr/panic.go' file contains a field 'Recover' of type 'interface{}'. This field can hold any data type, including sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or payment card information (PCI). If this data is not properly handled, it could lead to data privacy issues. This issue is classified as a 'Warning' severity issue.\n\n2. **Compliance with Regulations**: The project has potential issues with GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance. These issues are classified as 'Information' severity issues. Non-compliance with these regulations could lead to legal and financial repercussions.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment**: The project consists of a single file, 'gomerr/panic.go', which has both 'Warning' and 'Information' severity issues. This means 100% of the project files have issues. This high percentage indicates a potential risk to the overall health of the project.\n\n4. **Customer Impact**: If the data privacy issue is not addressed, it could lead to a breach of customer data. This could result in loss of customer trust, legal issues, and potential financial loss.\n\n5. **Architectural Impact**: The data privacy issue could necessitate a change in the project's architecture. The 'Recover' field in the 'PanicError' struct may need to be replaced with a more specific data type to ensure data privacy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project is well-structured and follows Go's idiomatic style, the data privacy and compliance issues pose a significant risk to the project's overall health and its customers. It is recommended that these issues be addressed promptly to mitigate potential risks.",
