It defines a struct called `UnmarshalError` which is used to handle errors that occur during unmarshalling of data. Unmarshalling is the process of transforming a byte-stream representation of an object back into the object itself.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of the code:\n\n```go\npackage gomerr\n```\nThis line declares the package name as `gomerr`. All the files within the same folder should declare the same package name.\n\n```go\ntype UnmarshalError struct {\n\tGomerr\n\tWhat   string\n\tData   interface{} `gomerr:\"include_type\"`\n\tTarget interface{} `gomerr:\"include_type\"`\n}\n```\nThis block of code defines a new type called `UnmarshalError` which is a struct. A struct in Go is a collection of fields.\n\n- `Gomerr`: This is an embedded type in the struct. It suggests that `UnmarshalError` struct is composed of or includes a `Gomerr` type. The `Gomerr` type isn't defined in this snippet, but it's likely a base error type defined elsewhere in the `gomerr` package. \n\n- `What string`: This field is a string that probably contains a description of the error.\n\n- `Data interface{} `gomerr:\"include_type\"` and `Target interface{} `gomerr:\"include_type\"`: These are fields of interface{} type, which means they can hold values of any type. The `gomerr:\"include_type\"` part is a struct tag. Struct tags in Go are string-based metadata about the field in a struct, accessible via reflection. They are often used to provide transformation instructions for encoding and decoding types. Here, it appears that the `gomerr` package uses these struct tags to include the type of `Data` and `Target` when handling the error.\n\nThe algorithm used here is simple: when an unmarshalling error occurs, an instance of `UnmarshalError` is likely created and populated with the relevant data, then returned or logged.\n\nFor more information on Go structs and error handling, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n- [The Go Blog: Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)"

It appears to be a function that is used to unmarshal or decode data into a target structure. Unmarshalling is the process of transforming a byte-stream back into a data structure for further processing. This is a common operation when dealing with data interchange formats like JSON, XML, or protocol buffers.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n\n- The function is named `Unmarshal` and it takes three parameters.\n- The first parameter is `what` of type string. This could be a description or identifier for the unmarshalling operation.\n- The second parameter is `data` of type `interface{}`. This is the data that is to be unmarshalled. The `interface{}` type means that `data` can be of any type.\n- The third parameter is `target` of type `interface{}`. This is the structure where the unmarshalled data will be stored. Again, the `interface{}` type means that `target` can be of any type.\n- The function returns a pointer to an `UnmarshalError` structure. This suggests that if any error occurs during the unmarshalling operation, it will be encapsulated in an `UnmarshalError` structure and returned to the caller.\n\nInside the function, it calls a `Build` function and passes a new `UnmarshalError`, `what`, `data`, and `target` as parameters. The `Build` function is expected to perform the actual unmarshalling operation and populate an `UnmarshalError` structure if any error occurs. The `new(UnmarshalError)` is a built-in function in Go that allocates memory for an `UnmarshalError` and returns a pointer to it.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result of the `Build` function as a pointer to an `UnmarshalError`. The `.(*UnmarshalError)` is a type assertion in Go, it asserts that the interface value returned by `Build` holds the concrete type `*UnmarshalError`.\n\nThis function does not implement an algorithm itself, but it is a part of the unmarshalling operation which is a common algorithm in data processing. It's also important to note that the actual unmarshalling operation and error handling are not visible in this code snippet, they are likely implemented in the `Build` function.\n\nFor more information about unmarshalling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [JSON and Go](https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go)\n- [Golang: How to Unmarshal JSON in Go](https://www.sohamkamani.com/golang/2018-06-20-marshalling-parsing-json/)"
