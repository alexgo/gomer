The `gomerr` package seems to be focused on error handling, as suggested by the name and the defined types. \n\nThe `import` statement is used to include the `reflect` package, which provides functions to dynamically interact with Go objects and types at runtime. It's a powerful tool for creating flexible code, but it should be used sparingly as it can make code harder to understand and debug.\n\nThe code is defining a new struct type named `BatchError`. This type embeds two other types:\n\n1. `Gomerr`: This is likely a custom error type defined elsewhere in the `gomerr` package. Embedding it in `BatchError` means that a `BatchError` is a `Gomerr` and can be used anywhere a `Gomerr` is expected. This is a common pattern in Go for creating new types that extend or modify the behavior of existing types.\n\n2. `errors []Gomerr`: This is a slice of `Gomerr` instances. The name `errors` and the fact that it's a slice suggest that a `BatchError` is intended to represent multiple errors that occurred together or in a batch operation. This is a common pattern in Go for handling multiple errors that can occur in a loop or concurrent operations.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, there's not much to discuss here as this is a type definition, not a function or method with logic or behavior. However, it sets the stage for more complex error handling elsewhere in the codebase. \n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the official blog post: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go). For more information on reflection in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: [Package reflect](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/)."

The function takes an array of errors as an argument and returns a single error.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. The function `Batcher` accepts an array of `Gomerr` (which seems to be a custom error type in the project) as an argument.\n\n2. It then checks the length of the array using a `switch` statement.\n\n3. If the length of the array is 0, it means there are no errors, so the function returns `nil`.\n\n4. If the length of the array is 1, it means there is only one error, so the function returns that single error.\n\n5. If the length of the array is more than 1, it means there are multiple errors. The function creates a new `BatchError` object, assigns the array of errors to it, and then returns this batched error.\n\nThe `Build` function seems to create a new instance of `BatchError`. The `(*BatchError)` is a type assertion in Go, it asserts that the result of `Build` is of type pointer to `BatchError`.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is a simple conditional branching (using a `switch` statement) based on the number of errors. This is a common pattern in Go when you need to perform different actions based on the length or size of an input.\n\nThe function adheres to the project's architectural guidelines as it follows a common pattern in Go for error handling and doesn't introduce any additional dependencies or architectural constraints.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)"

The switch statement checks the length of the `errors` slice and returns different values based on the length. If the length is 0, it returns `nil`. If the length is 1, it returns the first element of the `errors` slice. Otherwise, it creates a new `BatchError` object, assigns the `errors` slice to its `errors` field, and returns the `BatchError` object.\n\nSince there are no external library calls or non-standard functions in the code, the control flow graph is quite simple.

Variadic parameters allow a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments of a specified type.\n\nThe function `Batch` aims to collect all non-nil errors passed to it and return them as a batch. Here is a detailed explanation:\n\n1. `var nnErrors []Gomerr`: This line declares a slice of `Gomerr` called `nnErrors`. This slice will hold all non-nil errors.\n\n2. `for _, ge := range errors`: This line starts a for loop that iterates over each `Gomerr` in the `errors` slice. The `_` (blank identifier) is used to ignore the index of the current item.\n\n3. `if ge != nil`: This line checks if the current `Gomerr` (`ge`) is not nil.\n\n4. `nnErrors = append(nnErrors, ge)`: If the current `Gomerr` is not nil, it is appended to the `nnErrors` slice.\n\n5. `return Batcher(nnErrors)`: After all non-nil errors have been collected, the `Batcher` function is called with the `nnErrors` slice as its argument. The `Batcher` function is not defined in this code snippet, but it presumably returns a batched error of type `Gomerr`.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a simple filtering algorithm that iterates over a collection and filters out certain elements based on a condition. In this case, the condition is that the element (error) should not be nil.\n\nYou can learn more about error handling in Go from this link: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go).\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since there are no additional special architectural guidelines or constraints mentioned for this software project, we can say that the code is consistent with common Go practices. It uses slices, loops, conditionals, and error handling, which are all common features in Go. The function also appears to be stateless and does not seem to have any side effects, which aligns with the principles of functional programming and makes the function easier to test and reason about."

This method is part of a type named `BatchError`. \n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n- `func (b *BatchError) Errors() []Gomerr`: This is a method named `Errors` that belongs to the `BatchError` type. The `*` before `BatchError` means that the method operates on a pointer to an instance of `BatchError` type, meaning it can modify the instance. The method does not take any parameters and it returns a slice of `Gomerr` type.\n\n- `return b.errors`: The method returns the `errors` field of the `BatchError` instance. This `errors` field is a slice of `Gomerr` type, which is presumably a custom error type defined elsewhere in the code.\n\nThe purpose of this method is to provide access to the `errors` field of a `BatchError` instance. This is a common pattern in object-oriented programming known as an accessor or getter method. It is used to maintain the principle of encapsulation, where the internal data of an object is hidden from direct access, and can only be accessed or modified through methods.\n\nAs for the algorithms used, this is a very simple function that just returns a field from the struct, so there's no particular algorithm involved here.\n\nThis code is consistent with the Go best practices. In Go, it's common to define methods on types to provide access to their internal state. The `Gomerr` type suggests that the project has a custom way of handling errors, which is also a common practice in Go.\n\nFor more information on methods in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#methods. For information on error handling in Go, you can refer to this blog post: https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors."

This is useful when you want to pass complex data structures across network or want to store them in a way that retains their structure and data.\n\nThe code starts by getting the `reflect.TypeOf` the `BatchError`, which returns a `reflect.Type` that represents the dynamic type of the `BatchError`. The `String()` method is then called to get a string that uniquely identifies the type. This string is stored in the `batchTypeString` variable.\n\nIn the `ToMap()` function, it first initializes a slice of maps `errors` with the same length as the `b.errors` slice. Each error in `b.errors` is then converted to a map using the `ToMap()` method and added to the `errors` slice.\n\nA map `m` is then created with two keys: `\"$.errorType\"` and `\"Errors\"`. The `\"$.errorType\"` key is assigned the value of `batchTypeString`, which is the string representation of the `BatchError` type. The `\"Errors\"` key is assigned the `errors` slice.\n\nThen it checks if the `BatchError` has any attributes. If it does, it adds these attributes to the map `m` under the key `\"_attributes\"`. \n\nFinally, it returns the map `m`.\n\nThis code does not appear to use any specific algorithms. It is a straightforward conversion of a custom error type to a map for easier handling. \n\nFor more information on Go's `reflect` package, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to this blog post by the Go team: https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors"
