It follows a modular and structured approach, which is consistent with Go server applications. However, there is a potential privacy issue in the 'InternalError' structure in the 'gomerr/internal.go' file, which could expose sensitive information. This could impact the overall architecture if not addressed, as it could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, violating GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with this project is moderate. The main risk comes from the potential privacy issue in the 'InternalError' structure. If this structure is used to log or communicate error details, it could lead to disclosure of sensitive information. This could result in legal and financial penalties for non-compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: If the potential privacy issue is not addressed, it could lead to a breach of customer data. This could result in loss of customer trust, damage to the company's reputation, and potential legal and financial consequences.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The overall health of the project source is good, with only one file ('gomerr/internal.go') having detected issues. However, the severity of the issue is high, as it could lead to a breach of data protection regulations.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\n- **Health of the Project Source**: The health of the project source is generally good, with only one file out of the total having detected issues. This represents a small percentage of the project files having issues. However, the severity of the issue is high, which increases the overall risk.\n\nHighlights of the Analysis:\n\n- The project follows a modular and structured approach, which is consistent with Go server applications.\n- There is a potential privacy issue in the 'InternalError' structure in the 'gomerr/internal.go' file, which could expose sensitive information.\n- The risk associated with this project is moderate, mainly due to the potential privacy issue.\n- If the potential privacy issue is not addressed, it could lead to a breach of customer data, resulting in loss of customer trust, damage to the company's reputation, and potential legal and financial consequences.\n- The overall health of the project source is good, with only one file having detected issues. However, the severity of the issue is high, which increases the overall risk.",
