The architecture of the project is sound, following Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library. However, there are some potential risks and issues that need to be addressed.\n\n1. **Privacy Issue in `gomerr/internal.go`**: The 'InternalError' structure potentially exposes sensitive information. If this structure is used to log or communicate error details, it could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, violating GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. This issue is of high severity and needs immediate attention to avoid potential legal and reputational risks.\n\n2. **Logging Sensitive Information**: The same file `gomerr/internal.go` also has an issue with logging sensitive information. This could potentially lead to data breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n3. **Overall Health of the Project Source**: The project consists of a single file, `gomerr/internal.go`, which has been flagged with issues. This means 100% of the project files have issues of high severity. This is a significant risk and suggests that the project may need a thorough review and refactoring to address these issues.\n\n4. **Potential Customer Impact**: The issues identified could potentially impact customers by exposing their sensitive data. This could lead to loss of trust, legal implications, and potential loss of business.\n\n5. **No Additional Architectural Guidelines or Constraints**: The project does not have any additional special architectural guidelines or constraints. This could potentially lead to inconsistencies in the code and architectural design, and should be addressed by defining clear architectural guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project follows a sound architectural design, the issues identified pose significant risks that need to be addressed promptly. The project would benefit from a thorough review and refactoring, with a focus on data privacy and protection.",
