This package appears to be related to error handling, as suggested by the name and the content of the code.\n\nThe code defines a new type `BadValueType` which is a string. This type is used to categorize the type of bad value errors that can occur in the application. Four constants of this type are defined: `ExpiredValueType`, `GenericBadValueType`, `InvalidValueType`, and `MalformedValueType`, which provide specific categories of bad value errors.\n\nTwo additional string constants `reasonAttributeKey` and `expectedAttributeKey` are defined. These could be used as keys when providing additional information about an error.\n\nThe code then defines a struct `BadValueError` which embeds the `Gomerr` interface and adds additional fields `Type`, `Name`, and `Value`. This suggests that `BadValueError` is a specific type of error in the application, which includes information about the type of bad value error, the name of the value, and the value itself.\n\nThis code does not appear to use any specific algorithms, but it uses the concept of type embedding in Go. Type embedding is a way to reuse existing types and behavior, and it's a form of composition. In this case, `BadValueError` embeds the `Gomerr` interface, which means that it automatically gets all the methods that `Gomerr` has, and it can also add its own behavior.\n\nFor more information about error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n- [Effective Go: Errors](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#errors)"

The function's name is `BadValue` and it takes three parameters:\n\n1. `badValueType` of type `BadValueType`\n2. `name` of type `string`\n3. `value` of type `interface{}`\n\nThe function `BadValue` returns a pointer to a `BadValueError` object.\n\nThe `BadValue` function is used to create a new `BadValueError` object. This error type is usually used when a function receives a parameter that has an inappropriate value. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what the function does:\n\n1. The `new(BadValueError)` expression creates a new `BadValueError` object and returns a pointer to it. The `new` function in Go is a built-in function that allocates memory, zeroes it, and returns a pointer to it.\n\n2. The `Build` function is called with the `new(BadValueError)` pointer and the other parameters `badValueType`, `name`, and `value`. This function is probably used to set the fields of the `BadValueError` object. Unfortunately, without the implementation of the `Build` function, we can't say for certain what it does.\n\n3. The `.(*BadValueError)` part is a type assertion in Go. It asserts that the result of the `Build` function is a pointer to a `BadValueError` object. If the assertion is correct, the function will return this pointer. If not, the program will panic.\n\nThe algorithm used here is quite straightforward and is common in Go when working with custom error types.\n\nWithout additional context, it's hard to provide more specific analysis or links for further reading.

The function `InvalidValue` is used to construct and return an error of type `*BadValueError` when a value does not match the expected value. This function takes three arguments:\n\n1. `name`: a string that represents the name of the value.\n2. `value`: an interface that holds the actual value.\n3. `expected`: an interface that holds the expected value.\n\nThe function `InvalidValue` uses the `Build` function to create an instance of `BadValueError` and sets some attributes to it. The `Build` function is not defined in this code snippet, but based on context, it presumably constructs an error of a given type (`BadValueError`, in this case), sets an error type (`InvalidValueType`, in this case), and sets the name and value of the invalid value.\n\nThe `AddAttributes` method is then called on the result of the `Build` function. This method presumably adds additional attributes to the error. In this case, it's adding the expected value under the key `expectedAttributeKey`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the error instance, casting it back to `*BadValueError`.\n\nThe code follows a common Go pattern of creating and returning error instances with additional contextual information. This pattern is helpful in error handling and debugging, as it provides more information about the error than just a simple error message.\n\nThe algorithm used here is straightforward: it's creating an error, setting some attributes, and returning the error. There's no complex logic or data manipulation involved.\n\nFor more information about error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Working with Errors in Go 1.13](https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors)"

It defines a function named `MalformedValue` which takes two parameters and returns a pointer to a `BadValueError` type.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n```go\nfunc MalformedValue(name string, value interface{}) *BadValueError {\n\treturn Build(new(BadValueError), MalformedValueType, name, value).(*BadValueError)\n}\n```\n\n- `func MalformedValue(name string, value interface{}) *BadValueError`: This is the function signature. The function is named `MalformedValue` and it takes two parameters: `name` of type `string` and `value` of type `interface{}`. The `interface{}` type in Go is a way to accept any type, similar to `Object` in Java or `object` in C#. The function returns a pointer to a `BadValueError`.\n\n- `return Build(new(BadValueError), MalformedValueType, name, value).(*BadValueError)`: This is the body of the function. It calls another function named `Build` with four parameters: a pointer to a new `BadValueError`, a constant or variable named `MalformedValueType`, and the `name` and `value` parameters passed to the `MalformedValue` function. The `new` keyword in Go creates a new instance of a type and returns a pointer to it. The `Build` function presumably constructs a new `BadValueError` and returns it as an `interface{}` type. This return value is then type-asserted to a `*BadValueError` using the `.(*BadValueError)` syntax, and returned from the `MalformedValue` function.\n\nThis function seems to be a part of error handling in the software. It appears to create a new `BadValueError` with specific parameters, likely indicating that some value was malformed and caused an error.\n\nThe function doesn't seem to use any specific algorithm, but rather leverages Go's built-in language features for error handling and type assertion.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Errors - The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/pkg/errors/)\n  \nFor more information on interfaces and type assertions in Go, refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Interfaces - The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#interfaces)\n- [Type assertions - The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_assertions)"

The function takes two parameters: a `name` of type string and `expiredAt` of type `time.Time`. \n\nThe function `ValueExpired` is used to create a new instance of `BadValueError` when a value is expired. It uses the `Build` function to create the new `BadValueError` instance and initializes it with an `ExpiredValueType`, the `name`, and the `expiredAt` time. The new `BadValueError` instance is then returned.\n\nThe `Build` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to be a function that constructs a new error object based on the provided parameters. The `new(BadValueError)` expression creates a new instance of `BadValueError`, and the `.(*BadValueError)` type assertion ensures that the return value from `Build` is of type pointer to `BadValueError`.\n\nThe `ExpiredValueType` is likely a constant or variable that represents a specific error type or code, indicating that a value has expired.\n\nThis function is likely part of a larger error handling system in the software project. Error handling is a crucial part of any software project to ensure that the software can gracefully handle unexpected situations or invalid inputs.\n\nAs for the algorithm used, it's quite straightforward: \n1. The function takes two parameters, `name` and `expiredAt`.\n2. It calls the `Build` function with a new `BadValueError` instance and the parameters it received.\n3. It ensures the result of the `Build` function call is a `BadValueError` pointer and returns it.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Working with Errors in Go 1.13](https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors)"

It belongs to a method set of a type `BadValueError`. The function is named `WithReason` and it takes a single argument `reason` of type `string`. It returns a pointer to a `BadValueError`.\n\nThe function `WithReason` is a method on the `BadValueError` type. This suggests that `BadValueError` is a custom error type in the codebase, possibly used to represent errors that occur when a bad or invalid value is encountered.\n\nInside the function, it calls a method `AddAttribute` on the `BadValueError` instance (`bve`). The `AddAttribute` method is likely a method that adds some metadata to the error. In this case, it's adding a \"reason\" attribute, which provides more context about why the error occurred. \n\nThe `AddAttribute` method is called with two arguments: `reasonAttributeKey` and `reason`. The `reasonAttributeKey` is presumably a constant or variable defined elsewhere in the code that serves as the key for the reason attribute. The `reason` is the actual reason for the error, passed into the `WithReason` function.\n\nThe `AddAttribute` method returns an `error` interface, which is then cast to a pointer to a `BadValueError`. This is safe because the original type of the error was `BadValueError`. If the type assertion was not true, this would panic at runtime. However, since the method is called on a `BadValueError` instance, we can be confident that the type assertion will hold.\n\nFinally, the function returns the modified `BadValueError`.\n\nThis function is a common pattern in Go for adding context to errors. It allows you to attach additional information to an error, which can be very useful for debugging.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Errors in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Working with Errors in Go 1.13](https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors)\n- [Error handling in Upspin](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2017/12/error-handling-in-upspin.html) - This article discusses the design of Upspin's error package, which uses a similar pattern of attaching metadata to errors."
