It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, there is a potential architectural risk in the 'gomerr/notfound.go' file, which lacks data validation checks. This could lead to data exposure or manipulation if not addressed.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The 'gomerr/notfound.go' file has been flagged with a warning for Data and Privacy Compliance. This indicates a potential risk of data exposure or manipulation due to the lack of input validation. This risk could be mitigated by implementing input validation for the 'type_' and 'id' parameters, ensuring that inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL Injection or other forms of data manipulation.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The lack of data validation in the 'gomerr/notfound.go' file could potentially impact customers by exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized data manipulation. This could lead to a loss of trust in the product and potential legal implications.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has one file with a warning for Data and Privacy Compliance. This represents 100% of the project files, indicating a significant issue that needs to be addressed. However, it should be noted that this analysis is based on a single file, and the overall health of the project may be better than indicated by this metric.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Based on the analysis, the overall health of the project source is at risk due to the lack of data validation in the 'gomerr/notfound.go' file. This risk could be mitigated by implementing appropriate data validation checks. \n\nIn conclusion, while the project follows good architectural practices, there is a significant risk due to the lack of data validation in the 'gomerr/notfound.go' file. This issue should be addressed to ensure the security and privacy of the data handled by the library.",
