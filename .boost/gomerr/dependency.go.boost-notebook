Go is a statically typed, compiled language that is known for its simplicity and efficiency. It is often used in systems programming and for creating web servers.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n- `package gomerr`: This line declares the package name for this file. All Go files in the same directory should declare the same package name. The name `gomerr` suggests that this file is part of a package that handles errors in a Go application.\n\n- `type DependencyError struct {`: This line declares a new type `DependencyError` which is a struct. In Go, a struct is a composite data type that groups together zero or more values with different types. The struct `DependencyError` is meant to represent an error that occurs due to a dependency.\n\n- `Gomerr`: This line is an embedded field of the `DependencyError` struct. It means that all the methods and fields of the `Gomerr` type are directly accessible on the `DependencyError` type. The `Gomerr` type is not defined in this code snippet, but it is likely an interface or a struct defined elsewhere in the `gomerr` package that provides common error handling functionality.\n\n- `Service string`: This line declares a field `Service` of type `string` inside the `DependencyError` struct. This field probably stores the name of the service where the dependency error occurred.\n\n- `Request interface{} `gomerr:\"include_type\"`: This line declares a field `Request` of type `interface{}` inside the `DependencyError` struct. In Go, `interface{}` is the empty interface that can hold values of any type. The `gomerr:\"include_type\"` part is a struct tag that provides metadata about the `Request` field. Struct tags in Go are used by packages like `encoding/json` to control the encoding/decoding of the struct to/from JSON. In this case, it seems that the `gomerr` package uses the struct tag to include the type of the `Request` field when handling the error.\n\nThis code does not contain any algorithms, it is a simple type definition. \n\nFor more information about error handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go). For more information about struct tags, you can refer to the Go blog post: [The Go Programming Language Specification - Struct types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Struct_types)."

An interface in Go is a type that defines a set of methods but does not implement them. In this case, `request` can be any type that implements the interface.\n\n- Inside the function, it calls another function `Build` with three arguments: a new instance of `DependencyError`, `service`, and `request`. The `new` keyword in Go creates a new instance of a type. Here it creates a new instance of `DependencyError`.\n\n- The `Build` function presumably constructs an instance of a `DependencyError` with the provided `service` and `request`, and then returns it. The specifics of what `Build` does would depend on its own implementation, which is not provided here.\n\n- The return value of `Build` is type asserted to `*DependencyError` using `.(*DependencyError)`. This means the function is asserting that the returned value is a pointer to an instance of `DependencyError`. If the returned value is not of this type, the program will panic at runtime.\n\nThe algorithm used here is quite straightforward. It's essentially a factory function that creates and initializes a new `DependencyError` given a `service` and a `request`.\n\nThe function appears to be part of a larger error handling system, possibly for a microservices architecture where dependencies between services may cause errors. This function could be used to create a `DependencyError` whenever a service fails due to a dependency issue.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)"
