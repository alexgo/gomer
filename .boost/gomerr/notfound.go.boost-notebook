The code defines a new error type `NotFoundError` in the `gomerr` package. \n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n\n1. `package gomerr`: This line declares the package name for this file. In Go, all files in the same directory must have the same package name. The package name `gomerr` suggests that this package is related to error handling in some way.\n\n2. `type NotFoundError struct`: This line declares a new type `NotFoundError` which is a struct. In Go, a struct is a collection of fields. This type is presumably used to represent a specific kind of error where a requested resource is not found.\n\n3. `Gomerr`: This is an embedded type in the `NotFoundError` struct. It suggests that there is another type `Gomerr` which `NotFoundError` is based on. This is a way to achieve inheritance in Go. The `Gomerr` type would have methods associated with it that `NotFoundError` would inherit.\n\n4. `Type string`: This is a field in the `NotFoundError` struct of type `string`. This field likely represents the type of the resource that was not found.\n\n5. `Id string`: This is another field in the `NotFoundError` struct of type `string`. This field likely represents the identifier of the resource that was not found.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this code is straightforward and does not involve any complex algorithms. It simply defines a new type of error to be used in the codebase.\n\nThis code follows the standard Go conventions for error handling. In Go, errors are values, and defining custom error types like `NotFoundError` is a common practice. It allows for better control over error information and handling.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post on the topic: https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors."

This function takes two string parameters: `type_` and `id`, and returns a pointer to a `NotFoundError` type. \n\nThe `NotFoundError` is likely a custom error type defined elsewhere in the codebase. Custom errors in Go are usually defined as types that implement the `Error` interface by providing an `Error() string` method.\n\nThe function `Build` is called with parameters `new(NotFoundError)`, `type_`, and `id`. The `new` keyword in Go is used to allocate memory for a value of the specified type and returns a pointer to that memory. In this case, it's allocating memory for a `NotFoundError` and returns a pointer to it. This pointer is passed as the first argument to the `Build` function.\n\nWithout more context, it's hard to say what exactly the `Build` function does. However, based on its usage, it seems to construct or populate a `NotFoundError` with some information based on `type_` and `id`.\n\nFinally, the result of the `Build` function is type asserted to `*NotFoundError` and returned. The type assertion in Go is used to convert an interface value to another type. If the type assertion is invalid (i.e., the value is not of the asserted type), a runtime panic will occur. However, in this case, it's safe to assume that `Build` function is expected to return a value of type `*NotFoundError`.\n\nAs for algorithms, this code does not seem to implement any complex algorithm; it's mainly about creating a custom error and populating it with some data.\n\nFor more information about error handling and custom errors in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go). \n\nFor more information about `new` function and type assertions in Go, you can refer to the Go by Example tutorials: [new](https://gobyexample.com/new) and [type-assertions](https://gobyexample.com/type-assertions)."
