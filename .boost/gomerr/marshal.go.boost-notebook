This code snippet is part of a module named `gomerr`.\n\nThe `gomerr` package seems to be a custom error handling package in the project. It's a common practice in Go to have custom error types for better error handling and providing more context about the errors.\n\nThe code defines a new type `MarshalError` which is a struct that embeds `Gomerr` and adds two additional fields: `What` and `Value`. \n\n`MarshalError` is likely used when there is an error marshalling (converting) data into another format. The `What` field is a string that likely describes the error, and `Value` is the value that caused the error. The type of `Value` is `interface{}`, which means it can be any type. This is a common way in Go to handle values of unknown type.\n\nThe `Value` field has a struct tag `gomerr:\"include_type\"`. Struct tags in Go provide additional information about the fields in the struct. They can be accessed using reflection and are often used to define how a field should be handled by certain packages. In this case, the `gomerr` tag might be instructing the `gomerr` package to include the type of `Value` when handling this error.\n\nThis code is consistent with Go's idiomatic way of handling errors. It provides a way to add more context to errors, which can help with debugging and error handling in the application.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n- [Go Struct Tags](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-struct-tags-in-go)"

The function is named `Marshal` and it takes two parameters: a `string` named `what` and an `interface{}` named `value`. \n\nThe `interface{}` type in Go is a way to represent any type, similar to `Object` in Java or C#. It allows the `Marshal` function to accept any type of value as its second argument.\n\nThe function calls `Build` with `new(MarshalError)`, `what`, and `value` as arguments. The `new` keyword in Go creates a zeroed value of the specified type, in this case, `MarshalError`, and returns a pointer to it. The `Build` function is expected to populate this `MarshalError` instance with the provided `what` and `value`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result of the `Build` function call, cast to a pointer to `MarshalError`. The `.(*MarshalError)` syntax is a type assertion in Go. It asserts that the interface value returned by `Build` holds a `*MarshalError`.\n\nThe algorithm used here is straightforward:\n1. Create a new, zero-value instance of `MarshalError`.\n2. Call `Build` function with the new instance and provided parameters.\n3. Assert and return the result as a `*MarshalError`.\n\nWithout additional context or the implementation of `Build` and `MarshalError`, it's difficult to say more about this function. But it seems to be a part of error handling mechanism in a larger codebase, possibly used to create a specific type of error (`MarshalError`) with some associated data (`what` and `value`).\n\nFor more information on Go interfaces, type assertions, and error handling, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n- [Go Language Specification: Type assertions](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_assertions)"
