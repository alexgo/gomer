It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. However, the `gomerr/marshal.go` file has been flagged for potential data compliance issues, which could impact the overall architecture if not addressed.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The `gomerr/marshal.go` file has been flagged with GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance issues. This presents a significant risk as non-compliance with these regulations can lead to legal repercussions and financial penalties. The severity of these issues is marked as \"Error\", indicating a high level of risk.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: If the identified issues are not addressed, customers who use this library in environments where GDPR, PCI DSS, or HIPAA compliance is required could face compliance issues themselves. This could lead to a loss of trust in the library, and by extension, any products that use it.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The `gomerr/marshal.go` file is the only file in the project that has been flagged with issues. This suggests that the rest of the project is well-structured and follows best practices. However, the severity of the issues in this file is high, and they should be addressed as a priority.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\n- The project consists of a single file, `gomerr/marshal.go`, which has been flagged with high-severity issues. This means that 100% of the project files have been flagged with issues.\n- The severity of the issues is marked as \"Error\", indicating a high level of risk. This suggests that immediate action should be taken to address these issues.\n- Despite the issues in `gomerr/marshal.go`, the rest of the project appears to be well-structured and follows best practices. This suggests that the overall health of the project source is good, but the issues in `gomerr/marshal.go` should be addressed as a priority.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project is a well-structured Go library that focuses on constraint handling and validation.\n- The `gomerr/marshal.go` file has been flagged with high-severity GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance issues.\n- These issues present a significant risk and could have a major impact on customers who require compliance with these regulations.\n- Despite the issues in `gomerr/marshal.go`, the rest of the project appears to be well-structured and follows best practices.\n- Immediate action should be taken to address the issues in `gomerr/marshal.go` to mitigate the risk and potential customer impact.",
