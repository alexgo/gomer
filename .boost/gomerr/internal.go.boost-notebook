Go is a statically typed, compiled language that was designed at Google to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines, and large codebases.\n\nThe `package gomerr` declaration at the top of the code indicates that this code is part of the `gomerr` package. In Go, a package is a way of grouping related Go code together.\n\nThe `type` keyword is used to define a new type. In this case, `InternalError` is being defined as a struct type. A struct, or structure, is a user-defined type that allows you to combine data items of different kinds. Structures are used to represent a record.\n\nThe `InternalError` struct has two fields: `Gomerr` and `Issue`. \n\n- `Gomerr` is an embedded field of type `Gomerr`. This is a form of inheritance in Go. When a type is embedded in another type, the methods, interface implementations, and fields of the embedded type are available in the embedding type. This is a simple form of composition. The `Gomerr` type is not defined in this code snippet, so it's assumed to be defined elsewhere in the `gomerr` package.\n\n- `Issue` is a field of type `string`. This field will likely hold a description of the internal error.\n\nThis code doesn't explicitly include any algorithms. It's a simple type definition.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Go and its concepts, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)\n- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)\n- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)\n\nFor more specific information about error handling in Go, you can refer to these resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go 1.13 errors](https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors)\n\nIn terms of the architectural guidelines provided, this code snippet is too small to make any definitive statements. However, defining custom error types is a common practice in Go, and this code seems to follow that practice. The `InternalError` type could be used to provide more detailed error information than a simple error string, which could aid in debugging and error reporting."

This is a common pattern in Go for creating and initializing objects. The `new` keyword is used to allocate memory for the `InternalError` object.\n\nLet's break down what the function does:\n\n1. `new(InternalError)`: This creates a new instance of `InternalError`. The `new` function in Go creates a new instance of the type you pass to it, in this case `InternalError`, and returns a pointer to it. \n\n2. `Build(new(InternalError), issue)`: The `Build` function is called with the newly created `InternalError` and the `issue` string. The `Build` function is not defined in the provided code, but based on its usage, it likely initializes the `InternalError` with the provided `issue` and possibly performs other setup tasks.\n\n3. `.(*InternalError)`: This is a type assertion in Go. It asserts that the result of the `Build` function is a pointer to an `InternalError` object. If the `Build` function returns something that is not a pointer to an `InternalError`, this will cause a panic at runtime.\n\nThe overall algorithm of this function can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Allocate memory for a new `InternalError` object.\n2. Pass the new `InternalError` object and the `issue` string to the `Build` function.\n3. Assert that the result of the `Build` function is a pointer to an `InternalError` object.\n4. Return the pointer to the `InternalError` object.\n\nThis function is likely part of a larger error handling system in the software project. The `InternalError` type is probably a custom error type defined elsewhere in the codebase, used to represent errors that occur within the system. The `issue` string is likely a description or identifier for the specific error that occurred.\n\nFor more information on error handling and custom errors in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post on the topic: https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors\n\nFor more information on the `new` function and type assertions in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#allocation_new and https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_assertions respectively."
