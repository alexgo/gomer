It provides a way to define and group related behaviors. \n\nThe `Encrypter` interface in this code has two methods: `Encrypt` and `EncryptWithContext`. \n\n1. `Encrypt(plaintext []byte, encryptionContext map[string]*string) ([]byte, gomerr.Gomerr)`: \nThis method takes two parameters - a slice of bytes (`plaintext`) that represents the data to be encrypted, and a map (`encryptionContext`) that provides additional context for the encryption process. The method returns a slice of bytes, which is the encrypted data, and a `Gomerr` object, which represents any error that might occur during the encryption process. \n\n2. `EncryptWithContext(context context.Context, plaintext []byte, encryptionContext map[string]*string) ([]byte, gomerr.Gomerr)`: \nThis method is similar to the `Encrypt` method, but it includes an additional parameter at the beginning - a `context.Context` object. This object carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. \n\nThe `gomerr` package, imported from `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr`, is a custom error package in Go. It is used here to return any errors that might occur during the encryption process. \n\nPlease note that the actual encryption algorithm is not specified in this code. The `Encrypter` interface could be implemented by any type that provides the `Encrypt` and `EncryptWithContext` methods, and different implementations could use different encryption algorithms. \n\nFor more information on Go interfaces, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#interfaces\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to this blog post: https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go\n\nFor more information on the `context` package in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/context/ \n\nFor more information on encryption in Go, you can refer to the `crypto` package in the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/"

An interface in Go is a type that defines a set of method signatures. It is a way to define behavior. Any type that implements those methods is said to satisfy the interface.\n\nThe `Decrypter` interface has two methods:\n\n1. `Decrypt(encoded []byte, encryptionContext map[string]*string) ([]byte, gomerr.Gomerr)`: This method takes an encoded byte slice and a map of strings to string pointers as parameters. It returns a byte slice and a `Gomerr` object. The method is expected to decrypt the provided encoded data using the provided encryption context and return the decrypted data and any error that occurred during the process.\n\n2. `DecryptWithContext(context context.Context, encoded []byte, encryptionContext map[string]*string) ([]byte, gomerr.Gomerr)`: This method is similar to the `Decrypt` method, but it also takes a `context.Context` as a parameter. This context can be used to carry deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. It returns a byte slice and a `Gomerr` object. The method is expected to decrypt the provided encoded data using the provided encryption context and context and return the decrypted data and any error that occurred during the process.\n\nThe `Gomerr` object is a custom error type. It is not part of the standard Go library. It is likely defined elsewhere in this codebase or imported from an external package. Handling errors as types, like `Gomerr`, is a common pattern in Go. This allows for more control over error handling and enables the creation of more descriptive and helpful error messages.\n\nThe actual decryption algorithm is not defined in this code. The `Decrypter` interface only defines what methods a decryption algorithm should have. The actual implementation of these methods would be in a type that satisfies the `Decrypter` interface.\n\nFor more information on interfaces in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#interfaces\n\nFor more information on the `context.Context` type, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/context/\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to this blog post: https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors"

The code defines a new type, `Cipher`, which embeds two interfaces, `Encrypter` and `Decrypter`.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- `type Cipher struct`: This line declares a new struct type named `Cipher`. A struct is a composite data type, which allows you to group together zero or more items of possibly different types into a single entity.\n\n- `Encrypter`: This is an interface type that is embedded in the `Cipher` struct. In Go, an interface is a collection of method signatures. Any type that defines all the methods specified in an interface is said to implement that interface. The `Encrypter` interface is expected to be defined elsewhere in the code, and it should contain method signatures related to encryption operations.\n\n- `Decrypter`: This is another interface type that is embedded in the `Cipher` struct. Like `Encrypter`, the `Decrypter` interface is expected to be defined elsewhere in the code, and it should contain method signatures related to decryption operations.\n\nThe `Cipher` struct, as defined here, does not have any methods or fields of its own. Instead, it inherits the methods defined in the `Encrypter` and `Decrypter` interfaces. This means that any value of type `Cipher` can call the methods of `Encrypter` and `Decrypter`.\n\nThis is a common design pattern in Go, where a struct embeds interfaces to gain their methods. This pattern is often used to achieve polymorphism and code reusability. A `Cipher`, in this case, can be any object that can perform both encryption and decryption operations as defined by the `Encrypter` and `Decrypter` interfaces, respectively.\n\nFor more information on Go's interfaces and struct embedding, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [Go by Example: Embedding](https://gobyexample.com/embedding)\n- [Effective Go: Embedding](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#embedding)"

If these are used to encrypt or decrypt personal data, they may not meet GDPR requirements for data protection.\n\n   **Solution**: Ensure that the Encrypter and Decrypter provide strong encryption for personal data. Consider using standard encryption algorithms that are known to be secure.\n\n\n2. **Severity**: 7/10\n\n   **Line Number**: 34\n\n   **Bug Type**: PCI DSS\n\n   **Description**: The Cipher struct does not specify how it handles encryption keys. If it is used to encrypt cardholder data, it may not meet PCI DSS requirements for key management.\n\n   **Solution**: Implement secure key management practices. This includes securely generating, storing, and retiring encryption keys.\n\n\n3. **Severity**: 8/10\n\n   **Line Number**: 34\n\n   **Bug Type**: HIPAA\n\n   **Description**: The Cipher struct does not specify how it handles encryption keys. If it is used to encrypt protected health information (PHI), it may not meet HIPAA requirements for encryption and key management.\n\n   **Solution**: Implement secure encryption and key management practices. This includes using strong encryption algorithms and securely managing encryption keys.\n\n\n"
