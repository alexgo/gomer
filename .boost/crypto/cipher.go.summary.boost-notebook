It defines a `Constraint` interface and provides implementations for various constraint types. The code follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library.\n- The file `crypto/cipher.go` appears to be a critical part of the project, handling encryption functionalities. Any issues in this file could potentially impact the overall security and compliance of the project.\n\n**Risk Analysis:**\n- The project has several compliance issues related to GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. These issues are all found in the `crypto/cipher.go` file, indicating a high risk associated with this file.\n- The encryption functionality in `crypto/cipher.go` does not appear to implement strong cryptography for cardholder data, as required by PCI DSS Requirement 3.4. This poses a significant risk to the security of the project.\n\n**Potential Customer Impact:**\n- The lack of strong encryption could potentially expose sensitive customer data, leading to a breach of trust and potential legal implications.\n- The absence of a mechanism to record the processing activities of personal data, as required by GDPR, could lead to non-compliance issues and potential fines.\n\n**Overall Issues:**\n- The project has a total of 3 warnings related to GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance, all found in the `crypto/cipher.go` file.\n- The project has 2 encryption-related issues, also in the `crypto/cipher.go` file.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Based on the analysis, 100% of the project files have issues of varying severity. This indicates a high risk associated with the project.\n- The severity of the issues found is high, with warnings related to GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance, as well as encryption.\n\n**Highlights:**\n- The project is a Go library focusing on constraint handling and validation, with a clear separation of concerns and idiomatic Go style.\n- The `crypto/cipher.go` file, a critical part of the project, has several compliance and encryption-related issues.\n- The project has potential risks related to GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance, as well as encryption.\n- 100% of the project files have issues, indicating a high risk associated with the project.\n- The potential customer impact is high due to potential exposure of sensitive data and non-compliance with GDPR.",
