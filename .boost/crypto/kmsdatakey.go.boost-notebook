This package is likely used for cryptographic operations in the application. \n\nThe code imports several packages which are used for cryptographic operations, random number generation, and AWS Key Management Service (KMS). \n\nThe `crypto/aes` package provides Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implementation, a symmetric encryption algorithm.\n\nThe `crypto/cipher` package provides common cryptographic cipher interfaces.\n\nThe `crypto/rand` package provides a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n\nThe `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws`, `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/kms`, and `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/kms/kmsiface` packages are used for interacting with AWS KMS, which is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the cryptographic keys used to encrypt your data.\n\nThe `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr` package is likely a custom error handling package used in the application.\n\nThe code defines a constant `encryptedEncodingFormatVersion` and `encryptedEncodingFormatVersionByte` which are likely used to specify the version of the encoding format for the encrypted data.\n\nThe `kmsDataKeyEncrypter` struct is defined with two fields - `kms` and `keyId`. The `kms` field is of type `kmsiface.KMSAPI` which is an interface to AWS KMS.

This function is likely part of a larger project that handles encryption and decryption of data using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n1. `kmsClient` is an interface of type `kmsiface.KMSAPI`. This interface is provided by the AWS SDK for Go. It represents a client that can make requests to the AWS KMS service. The client is passed into the function, which allows for dependency injection, a software design pattern that improves testability and decoupling.\n\n2. `masterKeyId` is a string that represents the ID of a master key in AWS KMS. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt data keys.\n\nThe function returns an instance of `kmsDataKeyEncrypter`, which is a struct that implements the `Encrypter` interface. The `kmsDataKeyEncrypter` struct is initialized with the `kmsClient` and `masterKeyId` passed into the function.\n\nThe returned `Encrypter` can then be used to perform encryption operations, likely using the AWS KMS client to generate and encrypt data keys using the specified master key.\n\nThe comment at the top of the function indicates a future enhancement: adding support for asymmetric keys. Currently, it seems that only symmetric keys are supported.\n\nThis function is part of the Key Management Service (KMS) provided by AWS, which is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the cryptographic keys used to encrypt your data.\n\nFor more information on AWS KMS and the AWS SDK for Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)\n- [AWS SDK for Go API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/)\n- [AWS SDK for Go: kmsiface package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/kms/kmsiface/)\n\nThe function seems to follow the architectural guidelines and best practices for Go and for using AWS services."

The method is `Encrypt` and it is associated with the `kmsDataKeyEncrypter` type (which is likely a struct). The `Encrypt` method takes two parameters: a slice of bytes (`plaintext`) and a map with string keys and pointer to string values (`encryptionContext`).\n\nThe purpose of this method is to encrypt the provided plaintext using a specific encryption context. The encryption context is a set of key-value pairs that you can pass to AWS KMS along with the plaintext. AWS KMS uses the encryption context as additional authenticated data (AAD) when it encrypts and decrypts data.\n\nThe `Encrypt` method calls another method `EncryptWithContext`, passing `context.Background()`, `plaintext`, and `encryptionContext` as parameters. `context.Background()` returns a non-nil, empty Context, which is never canceled, has no values, and has no deadline. It is typically used by the main function, initialization, and tests, and as the top-level Context for incoming requests.\n\nThe `EncryptWithContext` method likely performs the actual encryption process, using the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) or similar. This method is not visible in the provided code snippet, but it would typically use an encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), provided by the AWS KMS service.\n\nThe `Encrypt` method returns two values: a slice of bytes (the encrypted data) and a `Gomerr` type. `Gomerr` is a custom error type used in this project for error handling. If the encryption process is successful, the method will return the encrypted data and a nil `Gomerr`. If there is an error, it will return a nil slice of bytes and a non-nil `Gomerr` containing information about the error.\n\nFor more information about encryption in AWS KMS, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [AWS Key Management Service Cryptographic Details](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/KMS-Cryptographic-Details.pdf)\n- [AWS KMS API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)\n- [Go context package](https://golang.org/pkg/context/)"

The AWS SDK for Go is used to interact with KMS.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. The function `EncryptWithContext` is defined on the `kmsDataKeyEncrypter` struct. It takes three parameters: a context, a byte slice representing the plaintext to be encrypted, and a map representing the encryption context.\n\n2. A `GenerateDataKeyInput` struct from the AWS KMS package is created. It is populated with the KeyId from the `kmsDataKeyEncrypter` struct, the provided encryption context, and a key specification string indicating the use of AES-256 encryption.\n\n3. The `GenerateDataKeyWithContext` function from the AWS KMS package is called with the context and input struct. This function generates a new data key. The generated data key is in plaintext and also returned encrypted under the provided KeyId.\n\n4. If an error occurs during key generation, the error is checked to see if it's an AWS error. If it is, the error code is checked and a custom error from the `gomerr` package is returned, providing more context about the error. If the error is not an AWS error, a generic dependency error is returned.\n\n5. If the data key is successfully generated, the `encrypt` function is called with the plaintext data key and the plaintext data to be encrypted. This function is not defined in the provided code, but it likely uses the data key to encrypt the plaintext data using some form of symmetric encryption (likely AES-256 given the key specification).\n\n6. If an error occurs during encryption, it is returned. Otherwise, the `encode` function is called with the encrypted data, a nonce (presumably generated during the encryption process), and the encrypted form of the data key. This function is also not defined in the provided code, but it likely combines these inputs into a single byte slice in some way.\n\n7. The result of the `encode` function is returned. This is the final encrypted output.\n\nThis code follows best practices for using AWS KMS to encrypt data. The AWS KMS service is used to generate a data key, which is used to encrypt the data locally. This allows the data to be decrypted without making a call to KMS, while still allowing the data key to be rotated or revoked through KMS.\n\nFor more information on AWS KMS and the AWS SDK for Go, refer to the following resources:\n\n- [AWS SDK for Go API Reference: KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/kms/)\n- [AWS Key Management Service Cryptographic Details](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/KMS-Cryptographic-Details.pdf)\n- [AWS SDK for Go Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html)"

The function `encrypt` takes three arguments - `key`, `plaintext`, and returns three values - `encrypted`, `nonce`, and `ge`. The `key` is the secret key for AES encryption, the `plaintext` is the data that needs to be encrypted. The function returns the `encrypted` data, a `nonce` (Number Once - a number or bit string that is used only once, in security engineering), and a `ge` which is a custom error value from the `gomerr` package.\n\n2. `aes.NewCipher(key)` creates a new cipher block using the AES algorithm and the provided key. If an error occurs (for example, if the key size is not 16, 24, or 32 bytes), the function returns an error wrapped with a message \"aes.NewCipher\".\n\n3. `cipher.NewGCM(block)` creates a new GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) using the given block cipher. The GCM mode is a type of symmetric key cryptographic block ciphers. If an error occurs (for example, if the block's block size is not 16 bytes), the function returns an error wrapped with a message \"cipher.NewGCM\".\n\n4. `aead.NonceSize()` returns the size of the nonce that must be passed to `Seal`. In this code, a nonce of the correct size is created and filled with random numbers from `rand.Reader`.\n\n5. `aead.Seal(plaintext[:0], nonce, plaintext, nil)` encrypts and authenticates `plaintext`, appends the result to the destination, which in this case is the slice `plaintext[:0]` (a slice of `plaintext` with length 0), and returns the updated slice. The nonce must be NonceSize() bytes long and unique for all time, for a given key.\n\n6. The function finally returns the encrypted data, the nonce, and nil (indicating no error occurred during the process).\n\nThis encryption function is consistent with standard cryptographic practices and doesn't seem to conflict with any architectural guidelines or constraints.\n\nFor more information on AES-GCM encryption in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [GoDoc for crypto/cipher](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/)\n- [GoDoc for crypto/aes](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/)\n- [GoDoc for crypto/rand](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand/)\n- [AES encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)\n- [Galois/Counter Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)"

The lengths are stored as 16-bit unsigned integers. The function takes three parameters, all of which are byte slices:\n\n1. `ciphertext`: This is typically the result of encrypting plaintext data.\n2. `nonce`: A nonce (number used once) is a random or pseudo-random number that is used in cryptographic communications to ensure security. It is used only once to prevent replay attacks.\n3. `ciphertextBlob`: This could be any additional encrypted data or metadata that needs to be stored along with the ciphertext and nonce.\n\nThe function follows these steps:\n\n1. A new `bytes.Buffer` is created. This will be used to build the final byte array.\n2. The `encryptedEncodingFormatVersionByte` is written to the buffer. This is likely a constant defined elsewhere in the code that indicates the version of the encoding format being used.\n3. The length of the `ciphertext` byte slice is written to the buffer as a 16-bit unsigned integer in little-endian format. Little-endian means the least significant byte is stored in the smallest address.\n4. The `ciphertext` byte slice itself is written to the buffer.\n5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for the `ciphertextBlob` and `nonce` byte slices.\n6. The contents of the buffer are returned as a byte slice.\n\nThe `binary.Write` function is used to write the length of each byte slice to the buffer. This function takes a `io.Writer`, a byte order (in this case, `binary.LittleEndian`), and a data value to write. The `_ =` before each call to `binary.Write` is used to explicitly ignore the error value that `binary.Write` returns. This is not considered best practice in Go, as it could lead to undetected errors.\n\nThis function does not seem to use any specific algorithm, but rather a specific process or protocol for encoding the given data into a specific format.\n\nFor more information on `bytes.Buffer` and `binary.Write`, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [bytes.Buffer](https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Buffer)\n- [binary.Write](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/binary/#Write)"

This struct has one field, `kms`, which is of type `kmsiface.KMSAPI`. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- `type`: This is a keyword in Go used to define a new type.\n\n- `kmsDataKeyDecrypter`: This is the name of the new type being defined, which in this case is a struct. The naming convention suggests that this struct is used for decrypting data keys using KMS (Key Management Service).\n\n- `struct`: This keyword is used to define a composite data type that groups together zero or more values of different types. In Go, structs are used to create user-defined types.\n\n- `kms`: This is a field in the struct. In Go, struct fields are accessed using dot notation.\n\n- `kmsiface.KMSAPI`: This is the type of the `kms` field. `kmsiface.KMSAPI` is an interface provided by AWS SDK for Go. This interface defines the set of methods that a KMS service client should have. By defining `kms` field as `kmsiface.KMSAPI`, the `kmsDataKeyDecrypter` struct can use any type that satisfies `kmsiface.KMSAPI` interface, which provides flexibility and makes testing easier.\n\nThe `kmsDataKeyDecrypter` struct is likely used to interact with AWS KMS service for decrypting data keys. The actual decryption would be done in methods associated with this struct, which are not included in the provided code snippet.\n\nFor more information on Go structs and interfaces, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)\n- [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [AWS SDK for Go: kmsiface package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/kms/kmsiface)\n\nAs per the architectural guidelines provided, this code snippet seems to be consistent with the general Go project structure. It defines a struct for a specific functionality (decrypting data keys using KMS), which is a common practice in Go."

It's designed to create and return an instance of a `Decrypter` interface. The function `KmsDataKeyDecrypter` receives a `kmsClient` as an argument, which should be a type that satisfies the `kmsiface.KMSAPI` interface, and returns a `Decrypter`.\n\nThe `kmsiface.KMSAPI` interface is a part of the AWS SDK for Go. It represents a subset of the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) API. This interface is used to interact with the AWS KMS service, which provides cryptographic keys and operations. More details can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/kms/kmsiface/).\n\nThe `Decrypter` is an interface (not shown in the code snippet) that is expected to have a method for decrypting data. The `kmsDataKeyDecrypter` struct (also not shown in the code snippet), which is returned by this function, is expected to implement this `Decrypter` interface.\n\nThe function essentially acts as a constructor for a `kmsDataKeyDecrypter` that uses the provided `kmsClient` to perform its decryption operations. This is a common pattern in Go, where interfaces are used to abstract the implementation details and promote loose coupling between components.\n\nThere isn't any complex algorithm involved in this function. It's more about design and architecture, specifically the use of interfaces for dependency injection and abstraction.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Go interfaces and how they are used, you can refer to this [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces) tutorial."

The function is named `Decrypt` and it takes two arguments: `encrypted`, which is a slice of bytes, and `encryptionContext`, which is a map of string pointers. The function returns two values: a slice of bytes and a `Gomerr` type, which is likely a custom error type used in this project.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to decrypt data that was previously encrypted. The encryption context is additional authenticated data that was provided at the time of encryption and must be supplied to decrypt the data.\n\nThe function `Decrypt` is a wrapper around the `DecryptWithContext` function. The `DecryptWithContext` function is presumably similar, but also takes a context as an argument. Contexts in Go are used to manage and cancel long-running tasks.\n\nThe function `Decrypt` creates a new context using `context.Background()` and passes this along with the other arguments to `DecryptWithContext`. The `context.Background()` function in Go is typically used as the top-level Context for incoming requests or for long-running background tasks.\n\nAs for the algorithm used, it's not specified in this function. The actual decryption would be done in the `DecryptWithContext` function. However, since the struct is named `kmsDataKeyDecrypter`, it's likely that the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is being used for encryption and decryption. AWS KMS uses envelope encryption, where the data is encrypted with a data key, and the data key is then encrypted with a master key.\n\nFor more information on AWS KMS and envelope encryption, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [AWS Key Management Service Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html)\n- [AWS KMS Envelope Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-s3-envelope-encryption.html)\n\nFor more information on contexts in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go Context Package](https://golang.org/pkg/context/)\n- [Go Blog: Contexts and Structs](https://blog.golang.org/context-and-structs)"

The function decrypts the encrypted content using an optional encryptionContext and returns the decrypted form of the encrypted content. \n\nThe function's parameters are:\n- `context`: the context within which the function will operate, used for things like timeout and cancellation signals.\n- `encrypted`: the encrypted data to be decrypted.\n- `encryptionContext`: a map of strings that provides additional authenticated data.\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:\n\n1. It calls the `decode` method on `k` (which is of type `kmsDataKeyDecrypter`) and passes the `encrypted` data. This method likely converts the encrypted data from its encoded form back into its original binary form and also extracts the ciphertext and nonce from it. The `nonce` is a random or pseudo-random number that is used in combination with the key for encryption and decryption.\n\n2. It then checks if there was an error (`ge`) during the decoding process. If there was an error, it returns `nil` and the error.\n\n3. It creates a `DecryptInput` struct and populates it with the `ciphertextBlob` and `encryptionContext`. The `DecryptInput` struct is an AWS SDK type used as input to the KMS (Key Management Service) `Decrypt` function.\n\n4. It calls the `DecryptWithContext` method on `k.kms` with the `context` and `input` as arguments. This method uses AWS's KMS to decrypt the `ciphertextBlob` using the specified `encryptionContext`.\n\n5. It checks if there was an error during the decryption process. If there was an error, it checks if the error is of type `awserr.Error`. If it is, it checks the error code and based on the error code, it wraps the error with a `gomerr` error and returns `nil` and the error. If the error is not of type `awserr.Error`, it wraps the error with a `gomerr.Dependency` error and returns `nil` and the error.\n\n6. If there was no error during the decryption process, it calls the `decrypt` method on `k` with the decrypted data key's plaintext, ciphertext, and nonce as arguments. This method likely uses the plaintext data key, ciphertext, and nonce to decrypt the ciphertext and return the original plain text data.\n\nThe function uses the `gomerr` package for error handling. This package defines a set of error types that can be used to wrap and add context to errors.\n\nFor more information about AWS KMS and the AWS SDK for Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n- [AWS SDK for Go API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/)\n- [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)\n- [AWS SDK for Go - KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/kms/)\n- [Gomerr](https://github.com/benjaminkomen/gomerr)"

It is a method of the `kmsDataKeyDecrypter` struct. The purpose of this function is to extract previously encoded values for ciphertext, ciphertextBlob, and nonce from the provided encoded byte array.\n\nThe function accepts a byte array `encoded` as an argument and returns four values: `ciphertext`, `ciphertextBlob`, `nonce` and `ge` (an error object of type `gomerr.Gomerr`).\n\nHere is a step by step breakdown of the function:\n\n1. A bytes buffer `reader` is created from the `encoded` byte array. This buffer will be used to sequentially read the encoded data.\n\n2. The function reads the first byte from the `reader` buffer and checks if it matches `encryptedEncodingFormatVersion`. If it doesn't match, the function returns an error using `gomerr.Unmarshal`.\n\n3. The function reads the next 2 bytes (uint16) from the `reader` buffer into the `length` variable using `binary.Read` with `binary.LittleEndian` byte order. This `length` represents the size of the following `ciphertext`.\n\n4. A byte slice `ciphertext` of size `length` is created and filled by reading `length` bytes from the `reader` buffer. If the read operation fails or the number of read bytes doesn't match `length`, the function returns an error using `gomerr.Unmarshal`.\n\n5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated to read `ciphertextBlob` and `nonce` from the `reader` buffer.\n\n6. If all the read operations are successful, the function returns `ciphertext`, `ciphertextBlob`, `nonce`, and `nil` error.\n\nThis function uses the concept of buffers, binary data reading, and error handling in Go. The error handling is done using the `gomerr` package, which is a Go package to handle errors in a more structured and meaningful way.\n\nFor more information about the used concepts, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Buffer types in Go](https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Buffer)\n- [Reading binary data in Go](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/binary/)\n- [Error handling in Go using gomerr](https://github.com/bdlm/errors)\n- [Little and Big Endian byte order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)"

The function is a method of the `kmsDataKeyDecrypter` type.\n\nThe function `decrypt` takes three parameters: `key`, `ciphertext`, and `nonce`. The `key` is the encryption key used for decryption. The `ciphertext` is the encrypted data that needs to be decrypted. The `nonce` is a random number used once, and it's needed for the decryption process.\n\nHere is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the code:\n\n1. `block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)`: This line creates a new cipher block using the provided key. The `aes.NewCipher` function returns a new AES cipher.Block, which is an interface that represents a block cipher running in its primitive mode. If there is an error, it returns the error.\n\n2. `if err != nil { return nil, gomerr.Internal(\"aes.NewCipher\").Wrap(err) }`: This line checks if there was an error creating the new cipher block. If there was an error, it wraps the error with `gomerr.Internal` and returns it.\n\n3. `aead, err := cipher.NewGCM(block)`: This line creates a new Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) with the given block cipher. GCM is a mode of operation for symmetric key cryptographic block ciphers that has been widely adopted because of its efficiency and performance. If there is an error, it returns the error.\n\n4. `if err != nil { return nil, gomerr.Internal(\"cipher.NewGCM\").Wrap(err) }`: This line checks if there was an error creating the new GCM. If there was an error, it wraps the error with `gomerr.Internal` and returns it.\n\n5. `plaintext, err := aead.Open(ciphertext[:0], nonce, ciphertext, nil)`: This line decrypts the ciphertext and returns the resulting plaintext. The `Open` function decrypts and authenticates ciphertext, returning the resulting plaintext. If the authentication fails, it returns an error.\n\n6. `if err != nil { return nil, gomerr.Internal(\"aead.Open\").Wrap(err) }`: This line checks if there was an error during the decryption. If there was an error, it wraps the error with `gomerr.Internal` and returns it.\n\n7. `return plaintext, nil`: If there were no errors during the decryption process, the function returns the decrypted plaintext and `nil` for the error.\n\nIn terms of architectural guidelines, this code follows the Go best practices for error handling by checking for errors after each operation that could potentially fail and returning early if an error is encountered. It also uses the `gomerr` package for wrapping and handling errors, which can provide more context about where and why an error occurred.\n\nFor more information about AES, GCM, and the Go `crypto/cipher` package, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go crypto/cipher package](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/)\n- [AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)\n- [GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)\n- [Go error handling best practices](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors)"

If an error occurs during this step, the control flow goes to the `ReturnError2` block, which returns an internal error wrapped with the underlying error from `cipher.NewGCM`.\n\nIf no error occurs, the control flow proceeds to the `Open` function, where the ciphertext is decrypted.
