It also appears to have authentication and authorization components. The architecture seems to be consistent with Go server applications, with a modular and structured approach. However, the 'Collection' interface in the `resource/collection.go` file exposes the 'data.Queryable' interface, which may allow unrestricted querying of data. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, violating GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with the project is moderate. The main risk comes from the potential violation of data compliance regulations due to unrestricted querying of data. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, which could result in legal and financial penalties. The risk is further increased by the fact that the issue is present in the `resource/collection.go` file, which seems to be a core part of the project.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The potential customer impact is high. If unauthorized access to sensitive data occurs, it could lead to a breach of customer trust and potential loss of customers. Furthermore, if the project is found to be in violation of data compliance regulations, it could result in the project being temporarily or permanently shut down, which would directly impact the customers.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The overall issues in the project are moderate. The main issue is the potential violation of data compliance regulations due to unrestricted querying of data. However, this is the only issue identified in the project, and it is present in only one file (`resource/collection.go`). The rest of the project files have no detected issues.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: The overall health of the project source is good. Only one file (`resource/collection.go`) has been identified with issues, and the severity of the issue is 'Warning'. This means that approximately 100% of the project files have issues of 'Warning' severity. However, since the project consists of only one file, this also means that 100% of the project files have no detected issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project has a solid architectural foundation and follows best practices for a Go server application, the potential violation of data compliance regulations due to unrestricted querying of data is a significant concern. This issue should be addressed as a priority to reduce the associated risks and potential customer impact.",
