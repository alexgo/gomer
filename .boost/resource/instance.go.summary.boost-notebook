However, there are some performance-related issues identified in the file `resource/instance.go`. The use of reflection in this file could potentially slow down the performance of the software, especially if the `NewQueryable` function is called frequently. This could impact the overall performance of the software and may need to be addressed.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with this project is moderate. While the code is generally well-structured, the performance issues identified could pose a risk to the overall performance of the software. The fact that these issues are present in the `resource/instance.go` file, which is a critical part of the software, increases the risk. \n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The potential impact on customers is dependent on how frequently the `NewQueryable` function is used. If it is a commonly used function, the performance issues could lead to slower response times and a less efficient user experience. This could potentially lead to customer dissatisfaction.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The overall issues in this project are relatively minor. The main issue is the performance-related issue in the `resource/instance.go` file. However, this issue could be mitigated by avoiding the use of reflection or by using a cache to store the results of reflection and reuse them when possible.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Based on the analysis, only one file out of the total project files has been detected with issues. This represents a small percentage of the total project files. However, the severity of the issues in this file is high, which increases the overall risk. \n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project is well-structured and follows Go's idiomatic style for a library.\n- Performance-related issues have been identified in the `resource/instance.go` file, which could impact the overall performance of the software.\n- The potential customer impact is dependent on the frequency of use of the `NewQueryable` function.\n- The overall risk of the project is moderate due to the high severity of the issues in the `resource/instance.go` file.\n- Despite the issues identified, a large percentage of the project files have no detected issues.",

It defines a `Constraint` interface and provides implementations for various constraint types. The code follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library. However, the identified issues in the `resource/instance.go` file could potentially impact the overall architecture of the project. The issues related to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance could necessitate changes in the data handling and storage mechanisms of the project.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The project has severe issues related to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance. These issues are present in the `resource/instance.go` file. The severity of these issues is high, with GDPR and HIPAA issues categorized as \"Error\". The risk associated with these issues is significant as non-compliance with these regulations can lead to legal repercussions and financial penalties.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The identified issues could potentially impact the customers in terms of data privacy and security. If the issues related to GDPR and HIPAA are not addressed, the customers' personal and health information could be at risk. This could lead to loss of customer trust and potential legal issues.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has a total of 1 file, `resource/instance.go`, with issues related to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance. The issues are categorized as \"Information\", \"Warning\", and \"Error\". The presence of \"Error\" level issues indicates serious problems that need immediate attention.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Given that all the files in the project have issues, the overall health of the project source is concerning. The presence of high severity issues in 100% of the project files indicates a high risk. Immediate action is required to address these issues and ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS regulations.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- The `resource/instance.go` file has severe issues related to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance.\n- The identified issues could potentially impact the customers in terms of data privacy and security.\n- The presence of \"Error\" level issues in the `resource/instance.go` file indicates serious problems that need immediate attention.\n- The overall health of the project source is concerning with high severity issues in 100% of the project files.",
