The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. \n\nHowever, the analysis has identified some issues that could potentially impact the overall project. The most severe issues found are related to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Improper Input Validation, both of which are located in the `resource/metadata.go` file. \n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issues could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. Insecure Direct Object References could allow an attacker to manipulate the system's behavior by providing malicious input. Improper Input Validation could also lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if malicious or incorrect data is not properly handled.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe analysis has identified a total of 3 issues in the `resource/metadata.go` file, with 2 of them being of Information severity and 1 of Warning severity. \n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall health of the project source is moderate. The `resource/metadata.go` file, which contains all the identified issues, represents 100% of the project files. This means that all the project files have issues of some severity. \n\n### Highlights\n\n1. **Architectural Soundness**: The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. \n\n2. **Security Risks**: The most severe issues found are related to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Improper Input Validation, both of which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed.\n\n3. **Customer Impact**: The identified issues could potentially impact the customers by allowing an attacker to manipulate the system's behavior or by leading to unexpected behavior if malicious or incorrect data is not properly handled.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**: All the project files have issues of some severity, indicating a moderate risk level for the overall health of the project source.\n\n5. **Recommendations**: It is recommended to address the identified issues, especially those related to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Improper Input Validation, to improve the overall health and security of the project.",

This could lead to performance degradation, especially when dealing with large data structures. This is a significant architectural concern as it could impact the overall performance and efficiency of the software. \n\n2. **Memory Usage:** The same file, `resource/metadata.go`, also has warnings and information level issues related to memory usage. This could potentially lead to memory leaks or inefficient memory usage, which could impact the software's performance and stability.\n\n3. **Database/Datastore Issues:** There is an information level issue related to the database or datastore in `resource/metadata.go`. While this is not a high-severity issue, it could still potentially impact the software's ability to efficiently interact with databases or datastores.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe high CPU and memory usage could lead to slower response times and decreased performance for the end-users. This could potentially lead to a negative user experience, especially for users dealing with large data structures.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe `resource/metadata.go` file appears to be the main source of issues in the project. It is responsible for all the warnings and information level issues detected. This suggests that this file, and the functionality it provides, may need to be reviewed and potentially refactored to address these issues.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nGiven that all the detected issues are in a single file, the overall health of the project source appears to be good. However, the severity of the issues in `resource/metadata.go` suggests that there is a risk to the project's performance and efficiency. \n\n### Highlights\n\n- The `resource/metadata.go` file is a potential risk area due to high CPU and memory usage issues.\n- The high CPU usage is due to the use of reflection, which is known to be computationally expensive in Go.\n- The memory usage issues could potentially lead to memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.\n- There is an information level issue related to the database or datastore in `resource/metadata.go`.\n- Despite the issues in `resource/metadata.go`, the overall health of the project source appears to be good.",

It defines a `Constraint` interface and provides implementations for various constraint types. The code follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library.\n\nHowever, the analysis has identified several high-severity issues related to data compliance, particularly in the `resource/metadata.go` file. These issues could potentially impact the overall architecture of the project, as they may require significant changes to ensure compliance with various data protection regulations.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issues could have a significant impact on customers, particularly those in regions or industries where data protection regulations are strictly enforced. Non-compliance with these regulations could lead to fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe analysis identified a total of 14 issues in the `resource/metadata.go` file, with varying levels of severity. The most severe issues relate to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall health of the project source is at risk. The `resource/metadata.go` file, which is the only file in the project, has several high-severity issues. This means that 100% of the project files have issues of varying severity.\n\n### Highlights\n\n1. **GDPR Compliance:** The `resource/metadata.go` file has 3 high-severity GDPR-related issues. These issues could potentially lead to non-compliance with GDPR, which requires explicit user consent for data collection and processing.\n\n2. **HIPAA Compliance:** The `resource/metadata.go` file has 4 high-severity HIPAA-related issues. These issues could potentially lead to non-compliance with HIPAA, which requires secure handling of Protected Health Information (PHI).\n\n3. **PCI DSS Compliance:** The `resource/metadata.go` file has 3 high-severity PCI DSS-related issues. These issues could potentially lead to non-compliance with PCI DSS, which requires secure handling of cardholder data.\n\n4. **Data Privacy and Exposure:** The `resource/metadata.go` file has 1 high-severity issue related to data privacy and 1 high-severity issue related to data exposure. These issues could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n5. **Overall Project Health:** The `resource/metadata.go` file, which is the only file in the project, has several high-severity issues. This means that 100% of the project files have issues of varying severity, indicating a high risk to the overall health of the project source.",
