<p>Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 6:49:26 PM PDT</p>
<h2 id="executive-report">Executive Report</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The software project under review is a server-side application, primarily written in Go, with a focus on data handling, constraints, and error management. The project appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for Go server applications. However, there are some areas of concern that need to be addressed to ensure the overall health and robustness of the project.</p>
<h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Insecure Error Handling</strong>: The most severe issue identified is in the file <code>_test/helpers/stores/panicstore.go</code>. The function &#39;Create&#39; uses a panic statement, which abruptly terminates the program. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service by triggering this function. It also indicates poor error handling as it does not provide meaningful error messages to the user. This issue is categorized as a warning, indicating a high level of severity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Exhaustion</strong>: The same file also has an issue of uncontrolled resource consumption, which could lead to resource exhaustion. This is a serious issue that could impact the performance and availability of the application, potentially affecting customer experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improper Error Handling</strong>: The file <code>_test/helpers/stores/panicstore.go</code> also has an issue of improper error handling. This could lead to unexpected behavior and could potentially be exploited by an attacker.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Overall Project Health</strong>: Based on the analysis, only one file out of the entire project has been identified with issues. This indicates that a majority of the project files are free from detected issues, suggesting a relatively healthy project source. However, the issues identified in the single file are of high severity and need to be addressed promptly to prevent potential exploits and ensure the robustness of the application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>The risk associated with the identified issues is high due to their potential impact on the application&#39;s performance, availability, and security. The issues of insecure and improper error handling could lead to unexpected termination of the program and provide potential exploits for attackers. The issue of resource exhaustion could impact the application&#39;s performance and availability, leading to a poor customer experience.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<p>To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactor the &#39;Create&#39; function in <code>_test/helpers/stores/panicstore.go</code> to replace the panic statement with proper error handling. This will prevent abrupt termination of the program and provide meaningful error messages to the user.</li>
<li>Implement controls to prevent uncontrolled resource consumption and ensure efficient use of resources.</li>
<li>Conduct a thorough review of the project to identify and fix any other potential issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>By addressing these issues, the project can ensure a robust and secure application that provides a reliable and efficient service to its customers.</p>

<p>Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 6:43:45 PM PDT</p>
<p>The provided code is written in Go language and is part of a package named <code>stores</code>. It imports two packages - <code>data</code> and <code>gomerr</code> - from a GitHub repository named <code>jt0/gomer</code>.</p>
<p>The code declares a global variable <code>PanicStore</code> of type <code>panicStore</code>. The <code>panicStore</code> is a struct type defined in the same package. It&#39;s an empty struct, which means it doesn&#39;t have any fields.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a detailed breakdown:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>package stores</code>: This line declares the name of the package that this file belongs to. In Go, all the files in the same directory must belong to the same package.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>import</code>: The <code>import</code> keyword is used to include code from other packages. This code imports two packages, <code>data</code> and <code>gomerr</code>, from a GitHub repository <code>jt0/gomer</code>. The <code>data</code> package likely contains data structures or functions for handling data, while <code>gomerr</code> is likely a custom error handling package.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>var PanicStore panicStore</code>: This line declares a global variable <code>PanicStore</code> of type <code>panicStore</code>. This variable is exported (because it starts with a capital letter), which means it can be accessed from other packages. The <code>panicStore</code> type is defined in the next line.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>type panicStore struct{}</code>: This line defines a new type <code>panicStore</code> as an empty struct. In Go, a struct is a collection of fields. An empty struct doesn&#39;t have any fields, but it can still be useful as a type to implement methods on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of this code isn&#39;t clear from the snippet alone, but it&#39;s likely that <code>PanicStore</code> is used as a singleton instance of <code>panicStore</code>, and that methods are implemented on the <code>panicStore</code> type elsewhere in the <code>stores</code> package.</p>
<p>As for algorithms, there aren&#39;t any algorithms used in this code snippet. It&#39;s mostly declarations and type definitions.</p>

<p>This piece of code is a function in Go language that belongs to the <code>panicStore</code> struct. The function is named <code>Create</code> and it accepts an argument of type <code>data.Persistable</code>. It returns a value of type <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code>. </p>
<p>The <code>data.Persistable</code> is likely an interface for data that can be persisted (saved) in some form of storage, though without more context, it&#39;s impossible to say exactly what that interface might look like.</p>
<p>The <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code> is a custom error type from the <code>gomerr</code> package. This package is designed to provide more flexible error handling in Go, allowing for richer error information and easier error wrapping.</p>
<p>The function body contains a single line of code: <code>panic(&quot;As promised&quot;)</code>. The <code>panic</code> function in Go is a built-in function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking. When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller.</p>
<p>In this case, the panic message is &quot;As promised&quot;, which suggests that the function is intentionally designed to panic whenever it is called. This would typically be done for testing purposes, or as a placeholder for code that has not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>There are no specific algorithms used in this function, as it consists of a single command to panic.</p>

<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 8/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 22</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: Insecure Error Handling</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The function &#39;Create&#39; uses a panic statement, which abruptly terminates the program. This could be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service by triggering this function. Panics are also indicative of poor error handling as they do not provide meaningful error messages to the user.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Instead of panicking, it is recommended to return an error to the caller, allowing them to handle it appropriately. This provides a better user experience and reduces the risk of unexpected program termination.

<p>The code snippet you&#39;ve provided is a function named <code>Read</code> that is a method of a type named <code>panicStore</code>. This function takes an argument of type <code>data.Persistable</code> and returns a value of type <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code>. </p>
<p>The <code>Read</code> function is designed to panic with the message &quot;As promised&quot;. The <code>panic</code> function in Go is a built-in function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking. When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller. </p>
<p>In this case, the <code>Read</code> function doesn&#39;t do anything with the <code>data.Persistable</code> argument it receives. It is designed to panic immediately when called, which is not typical behavior for a <code>Read</code> function. Usually, a <code>Read</code> function would read some data from a data source and return it or an error if there was a problem.</p>
<p>The <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code> type appears to be a custom error type from a package named <code>gomerr</code>. Custom error types in Go are usually used to add more context or functionality to errors. Without more information, it&#39;s hard to say exactly what additional capabilities this <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code> type might provide.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that this function is a method of a type named <code>panicStore</code>. This suggests that this type might be used to mock or simulate a data store for testing purposes. The fact that it panics when its <code>Read</code> method is called could be a way to simulate a catastrophic failure of the data store.</p>

<li><p><strong>Severity</strong>: 7/10</p>
<p><strong>Line Number</strong>: 30</p>
<p><strong>Bug Type</strong>: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (&#39;Resource Exhaustion&#39;)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The function causes a panic which can lead to abrupt termination of the program. This is not a good practice as it can lead to resource exhaustion if the function is called repeatedly, causing the application to crash. It can also lead to information disclosure if the panic information is displayed to the end user. More details about this type of issue can be found here: <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Uncontrolled_Resource_Consumption">https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Uncontrolled_Resource_Consumption</a></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Instead of causing a panic, it would be better to return an error. This allows the calling function to handle the error in a controlled manner, preventing abrupt termination of the program. Go&#39;s built-in error handling can be used for this purpose.

<p>This is a relatively simple piece of Go code. It defines a method called <code>Update</code> on a struct called <code>panicStore</code>. This method takes two arguments of the type <code>data.Persistable</code> and returns a value of type <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code>. </p>
<p>The <code>Update</code> method immediately calls the built-in <code>panic</code> function with the string &quot;As promised&quot;. The <code>panic</code> function in Go stops the ordinary flow of control, begins panicking, and when the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller.</p>
<p>As for the architectural guidelines, since there are no additional special architectural guidelines or constraints provided for this software project, we can only analyze it based on general Go programming best practices. </p>
<p>Here, the <code>panic</code> function is generally used to fail fast on errors that shouldn’t occur during normal operation, or that aren’t prepared to handle gracefully. In this case, it&#39;s being used to indicate that the <code>Update</code> method is not implemented or not supposed to be called.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s worth noting that using <code>panic</code> is not a common way to handle errors in Go. The idiomatic way to handle errors in Go is to return an error as the last return value of a function and to check that error in the calling function.</p>
<p>As for the types <code>data.Persistable</code> and <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code>, without more context, we can only infer that <code>data.Persistable</code> is likely an interface defining methods for data that can be persisted (saved to a database or file system, for example), and <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code> is likely a custom error type, possibly from the &quot;gomerr&quot; package.</p>

<p>The provided code snippet is a function in Go (Golang), a statically typed, compiled language developed at Google. This function is a method of the struct <code>panicStore</code>.</p>
<p>This function, <code>Delete</code>, takes an argument of type <code>data.Persistable</code> and returns a value of type <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code>. The <code>data.Persistable</code> type suggests that this function is intended to delete a persistable data object, possibly representing a record in a database or other persistent storage. </p>
<p>The <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code> type is a custom error type from the <code>gomerr</code> package, which is a Go package for creating and handling errors. This indicates that the function will return a <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code> error if something goes wrong during execution.</p>
<p>The function body contains a single line, <code>panic(&quot;As promised&quot;)</code>. The <code>panic</code> function in Go is a built-in function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking. When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller. To the caller, F then behaves like a call to panic. The process continues up the stack until all functions in the current goroutine have returned, at which point the program crashes. Panics are typically triggered when an unrecoverable error occurs, or during debugging.</p>
<p>The string &quot;As promised&quot; passed to <code>panic</code> will be the message displayed when the panic occurs. The name of the struct <code>panicStore</code> and the panic message suggest that this is a mock or placeholder implementation, used for testing or as a stand-in until a real implementation is provided.</p>
<p>This function doesn&#39;t seem to be using any complex algorithms, and it&#39;s not clear from this snippet alone what the broader architecture of the software project might be. However, it appears to be consistent with Go&#39;s error handling philosophy, which encourages functions to return errors as their last return value.</p>

<p>This is a function in Go programming language. The function is defined on a type called <code>panicStore</code>. It accepts an argument of type <code>data.Queryable</code> and returns a <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code> type. <code>gomerr.Gomerr</code> is a custom error type used in Go for improved error handling.</p>
<p>The function body contains a single line of code that causes the function to panic. The <code>panic</code> function in Go is a built-in function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking. When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller. To the caller, F then behaves like a call to panic. The process continues up the stack until all functions in the current goroutine have returned, at which point the program crashes. Panics can be initiated by invoking panic directly. They can also be caused by runtime errors, such as out-of-bounds array accesses.</p>
<p>In this case, the <code>panic</code> function is called with a string argument <code>&quot;As promised&quot;</code>. This string will be printed out as a message when the panic occurs.</p>
<p>The function is named <code>Query</code> which suggests that it is intended to perform some kind of data query operation. However, because it always panics, it seems to be a placeholder or stub function that has not yet been implemented. It could also be a dummy function used for testing purposes.</p>
<p>Here are some resources to learn more about panic in Go:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gobyexample.com/panic">Go by Example: Panic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover">Go Blog: Defer, Panic, and Recover</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#panic">Go Documentation: Built-in functions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As for architectural guidelines, the use of panic is generally discouraged in Go, especially for normal error handling. It&#39;s more idiomatic in Go to return errors as an explicit, separate return value. This makes error handling more explicit and less likely to be overlooked by developers. However, there might be cases where panic is appropriate, for example during initialization where recovery is not possible.</p>
