### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 3:00:02 PM PDT

This code is written in the Go programming language and defines a new error type named `StoreError` that extends the `Gomerr` error type from the `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr` package. This code is likely part of a larger data management or storage system, given the naming conventions used.

Let's break down the code in detail:

1. `package dataerr`: This line declares the package name as `dataerr`. All the code within this file is part of the `dataerr` package.

2. `import (...)`: This is the import statement, which is used to include other packages in the code. In this case, it's importing the `gomerr` package from `github.com/jt0/gomer`. The `gomerr` package provides a flexible error handling mechanism for Go applications.

3. `type StoreError struct {...}`: This line declares a new type `StoreError` which is a struct (a collection of fields). `StoreError` is an extension of the `Gomerr` type. This means that `StoreError` inherits all the properties and methods of `Gomerr`, but can also have additional fields. In this case, `StoreError` has two additional fields: `Operation` and `Data`.

4. `Operation string`: This line declares a field named `Operation` of type string. This field likely stores information about the operation that caused the error.

5. `Data interface{} `gomerr:"include_type"`: This line declares a field named `Data` of type `interface{}`. In Go, `interface{}` is the empty interface, which can hold values of any type. The `gomerr:"include_type"` tag is an instruction to the `gomerr` package to include the type of the `Data` value when the error is formatted.

The algorithm used in this code is straightforward: it defines a new type `StoreError` that extends the `Gomerr` type and adds two additional fields. There are no complex algorithms used in this code snippet.

1. **Severity**: 3/10

   **Line Number**: 1

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The Gomerr package is known to use reflection which is computationally expensive and can lead to high memory usage.

   **Solution**: Consider using traditional error handling in Go. If you need more context, consider using the new errors package from Go 1.13, which has a lower memory footprint and better performance.


2. **Severity**: 2/10

   **Line Number**: 9

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The Data field in the StoreError struct is of type interface{}, which can hold any type. This can lead to high memory usage if large data structures are stored.

   **Solution**: Consider using a more specific type for the Data field if possible. If the data can be large, consider storing a reference or identifier instead of the data itself.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 3:00:20 PM PDT

The code snippet you've provided is a function in Go programming language. This function, `Store`, takes two parameters - `operation` of type `string` and `data` of type `interface{}`. The function returns a pointer to a `StoreError` type.

Let's break down the function:

1. `func Store(operation string, data interface{}) *StoreError`: This is the function signature. The function is named `Store`, it accepts two parameters and returns a pointer to `StoreError`.

2. `operation` is the first parameter of type `string`. This parameter likely represents some kind of operation that is being performed in the context of this function.

3. `data` is the second parameter of type `interface{}`. `interface{}` in Go is a way to accept any type of data. This parameter is likely the data that is being processed or manipulated in the operation.

4. `return gomerr.Build(new(StoreError), operation, data).(*StoreError)`: The function returns a value generated by `gomerr.Build()`. `gomerr` is likely a package or module that provides error handling capabilities. `Build()` is a function from `gomerr` that is used to construct a new error.

    - `new(StoreError)` creates a new instance of `StoreError` type. This instance is passed to `gomerr.Build()` as the first argument.

    - `operation` and `data` are passed to `gomerr.Build()` as the second and third arguments respectively. The `Build()` function likely uses these values to generate a detailed error message.

    - `.(*StoreError)` is a type assertion in Go. It asserts that the value returned by `gomerr.Build()` is of type `*StoreError`.

In terms of algorithm, this function is relatively straightforward. It's essentially a wrapper around `gomerr.Build()` that constructs a new `StoreError` with the given operation and data.

As for architectural guidelines, this function seems to follow good practices. It's a simple, single-purpose function that relies on a separate module (`gomerr`) for error handling, which promotes separation of concerns.

For more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)

### Boost Flow Diagram

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 3:00:40 PM PDT

```mermaid
graph TD;
style Start fill:#228B22, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:2px;
style ExampleProcess fill:#228B22, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:4px;
style ExampleErrorPath fill:#B22222, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:2px;

Start-->ExampleProcess;
Start-->ExampleErrorPath;
ExampleProcess-->End;
ExampleErrorPath-->End;
```

The control flow graph for the provided code snippet is a simple linear flow. The function `Store` takes in two parameters, `operation` and `data`. It then calls the `Build` function from the `gomerr` package, passing in the `StoreError` type, `operation`, and `data`. The result of the `Build` function is then cast to `*StoreError` and returned.

There are no external library or non-standard function calls in this code snippet.

### Boost Source-Level Performance Analysis

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 3:01:44 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 22

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The function `Store` creates a new instance of `StoreError` every time it's called. This could potentially lead to high memory usage if the function is called frequently.

   **Solution**: Consider using a pool of `StoreError` objects that can be reused, to reduce the frequency of memory allocation and deallocation. This pattern is called object pooling. You can use the `sync.Pool` type in Go to implement this pattern. Here is a link to the Go documentation for `sync.Pool`: https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Pool


2. **Severity**: 6/10

   **Line Number**: 23

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The function `gomerr.Build` uses reflection to create a new error. Reflection is slow and can lead to high CPU usage, especially if the function is called frequently.

   **Solution**: Avoid using reflection where possible. Consider using a more direct method to create the error. For example, you could define a constructor function for `StoreError` that takes the necessary parameters and returns a new instance of the error.

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 3:02:50 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 8/10

   **Line Number**: 24

   **Bug Type**: Data Privacy

   **Description**: The function 'Store' does not have any form of encryption or hashing when storing data. This could lead to sensitive data being exposed in plain text, violating GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.

   **Solution**: Implement encryption or hashing when storing data. Use libraries such as bcrypt for hashing or AES for encryption to ensure sensitive data is not stored in plain text.
