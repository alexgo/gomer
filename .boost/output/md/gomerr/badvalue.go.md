### Boost Architectural Quick Summary Security Report

Last Updated: Friday, September 8, 2023 at 1:59:14 PM PDT

## Executive Report

### Architectural Impact and Risk Analysis

The software project under review is a library written in Go that focuses on constraint handling and validation. It defines a `Constraint` interface and provides implementations for various constraint types. The code follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library.

However, the analysis has identified some issues that could potentially impact the overall project. The most severe issues found are related to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Unvalidated Inputs. These issues were found in the file `gomerr/badvalue.go`.

### Potential Customer Impact

The identified issues could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) can allow an attacker to bypass authorization and access resources directly by modifying the value of a parameter used to directly point to an object. Unvalidated Inputs can lead to various types of attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Remote Code Execution (RCE).

### Overall Issues

The project consists of a single file, `gomerr/badvalue.go`, which has been identified to contain issues. This means that 100% of the project files have issues of varying severity.

### Risk Assessment

Given that all the project files have been identified to contain issues, the overall health of the project source is at risk. The severity of the issues found is high, which further increases the risk level.

### Highlights of the Analysis

- The project is a Go library focusing on constraint handling and validation.
- The most severe issues found are related to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Unvalidated Inputs.
- These issues were found in the file `gomerr/badvalue.go`.
- 100% of the project files have been identified to contain issues.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 4:40:32 PM PDT

This code is written in Go and it defines a package named `gomerr`. This package appears to be related to error handling, as suggested by the name and the content of the code.

The code defines a new type `BadValueType` which is a string. This type is used to categorize the type of bad value errors that can occur in the application. Four constants of this type are defined: `ExpiredValueType`, `GenericBadValueType`, `InvalidValueType`, and `MalformedValueType`, which provide specific categories of bad value errors.

Two additional string constants `reasonAttributeKey` and `expectedAttributeKey` are defined. These could be used as keys when providing additional information about an error.

The code then defines a struct `BadValueError` which embeds the `Gomerr` interface and adds additional fields `Type`, `Name`, and `Value`. This suggests that `BadValueError` is a specific type of error in the application, which includes information about the type of bad value error, the name of the value, and the value itself.

This code does not appear to use any specific algorithms, but it uses the concept of type embedding in Go. Type embedding is a way to reuse existing types and behavior, and it's a form of composition. In this case, `BadValueError` embeds the `Gomerr` interface, which means that it automatically gets all the methods that `Gomerr` has, and it can also add its own behavior.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 4:41:07 PM PDT

The provided code snippet is a function written in Go language. The function's name is `BadValue` and it takes three parameters:

1. `badValueType` of type `BadValueType`
2. `name` of type `string`
3. `value` of type `interface{}`

The function `BadValue` returns a pointer to a `BadValueError` object.

The `BadValue` function is used to create a new `BadValueError` object. This error type is usually used when a function receives a parameter that has an inappropriate value. 

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

1. The `new(BadValueError)` expression creates a new `BadValueError` object and returns a pointer to it. The `new` function in Go is a built-in function that allocates memory, zeroes it, and returns a pointer to it.

2. The `Build` function is called with the `new(BadValueError)` pointer and the other parameters `badValueType`, `name`, and `value`. This function is probably used to set the fields of the `BadValueError` object. Unfortunately, without the implementation of the `Build` function, we can't say for certain what it does.

3. The `.(*BadValueError)` part is a type assertion in Go. It asserts that the result of the `Build` function is a pointer to a `BadValueError` object. If the assertion is correct, the function will return this pointer. If not, the program will panic.

The algorithm used here is quite straightforward and is common in Go when working with custom error types.

Without additional context, it's hard to provide more specific analysis or links for further reading. However, you might find the following resources helpful for understanding the concepts used in this code:

1. **Severity**: 2/10

   **Line Number**: 44

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The function `BadValue` creates a new `BadValueError` object every time it is called, which could lead to high memory usage if the function is called frequently.

   **Solution**: Consider using a pool of `BadValueError` objects that can be reused, instead of creating a new object every time the function is called. This can help to reduce memory usage. You can use the `sync.Pool` type in Go for this purpose. Here is a link to the official Go documentation for `sync.Pool`: https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Pool

```
## Boost Analysis:

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 4:41:38 PM PDT

The code snippet provided is a function written in Go language. The function `InvalidValue` is used to construct and return an error of type `*BadValueError` when a value does not match the expected value. This function takes three arguments:

1. `name`: a string that represents the name of the value.
2. `value`: an interface that holds the actual value.
3. `expected`: an interface that holds the expected value.

The function `InvalidValue` uses the `Build` function to create an instance of `BadValueError` and sets some attributes to it. The `Build` function is not defined in this code snippet, but based on context, it presumably constructs an error of a given type (`BadValueError`, in this case), sets an error type (`InvalidValueType`, in this case), and sets the name and value of the invalid value.

The `AddAttributes` method is then called on the result of the `Build` function. This method presumably adds additional attributes to the error. In this case, it's adding the expected value under the key `expectedAttributeKey`.

Finally, the function returns the error instance, casting it back to `*BadValueError`.

The code follows a common Go pattern of creating and returning error instances with additional contextual information. This pattern is helpful in error handling and debugging, as it provides more information about the error than just a simple error message.

The algorithm used here is straightforward: it's creating an error, setting some attributes, and returning the error. There's no complex logic or data manipulation involved.

1. **Severity**: 2/10

   **Line Number**: 52

   **Bug Type**: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

   **Description**: The function `InvalidValue` takes a value and an expected value as parameters. If an attacker can predict or control the `value` parameter, they might be able to access or modify data they are not supposed to. This is known as Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). More information about this type of vulnerability can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control

   **Solution**: To prevent this, it's recommended to implement proper access controls and to not expose direct references to internal implementation objects. An access control check should be performed before the function is executed to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the operation. More information about preventing IDOR can be found here: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html

## Boost Analysis:

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 4:42:01 PM PDT

This code is written in Go programming language. It defines a function named `MalformedValue` which takes two parameters and returns a pointer to a `BadValueError` type.

Let's break down the code:

```go
func MalformedValue(name string, value interface{}) *BadValueError {
	return Build(new(BadValueError), MalformedValueType, name, value).(*BadValueError)
}
```

- `func MalformedValue(name string, value interface{}) *BadValueError`: This is the function signature. The function is named `MalformedValue` and it takes two parameters: `name` of type `string` and `value` of type `interface{}`. The `interface{}` type in Go is a way to accept any type, similar to `Object` in Java or `object` in C#. The function returns a pointer to a `BadValueError`.

- `return Build(new(BadValueError), MalformedValueType, name, value).(*BadValueError)`: This is the body of the function. It calls another function named `Build` with four parameters: a pointer to a new `BadValueError`, a constant or variable named `MalformedValueType`, and the `name` and `value` parameters passed to the `MalformedValue` function. The `new` keyword in Go creates a new instance of a type and returns a pointer to it. The `Build` function presumably constructs a new `BadValueError` and returns it as an `interface{}` type. This return value is then type-asserted to a `*BadValueError` using the `.(*BadValueError)` syntax, and returned from the `MalformedValue` function.

This function seems to be a part of error handling in the software. It appears to create a new `BadValueError` with specific parameters, likely indicating that some value was malformed and caused an error.

The function doesn't seem to use any specific algorithm, but rather leverages Go's built-in language features for error handling and type assertion.

1. **Severity**: 7/10

   **Line Number**: 62

   **Bug Type**: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

   **Description**: The function `MalformedValue` is directly using the `name` argument without any validation. This can lead to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) if an attacker can manipulate the `name` to reference objects that they should not have access to. More about IDOR can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control

   **Solution**: Always validate and sanitize input data. Implement access control checks to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the operation.

2. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 62

   **Bug Type**: Unvalidated Inputs

   **Description**: The function `MalformedValue` does not perform any validation on the `value` argument.

## Boost Analysis:



---

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 4:42:33 PM PDT

This Go code defines a function, `ValueExpired`, which returns a pointer to a `BadValueError` type. The function takes two parameters: a `name` of type string and `expiredAt` of type `time.Time`. 

The function `ValueExpired` is used to create a new instance of `BadValueError` when a value is expired. It uses the `Build` function to create the new `BadValueError` instance and initializes it with an `ExpiredValueType`, the `name`, and the `expiredAt` time. The new `BadValueError` instance is then returned.

The `Build` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to be a function that constructs a new error object based on the provided parameters. The `new(BadValueError)` expression creates a new instance of `BadValueError`, and the `.(*BadValueError)` type assertion ensures that the return value from `Build` is of type pointer to `BadValueError`.

The `ExpiredValueType` is likely a constant or variable that represents a specific error type or code, indicating that a value has expired.

This function is likely part of a larger error handling system in the software project. Error handling is a crucial part of any software project to ensure that the software can gracefully handle unexpected situations or invalid inputs.

As for the algorithm used, it's quite straightforward: 
1. The function takes two parameters, `name` and `expiredAt`.
2. It calls the `Build` function with a new `BadValueError` instance and the parameters it received.
3. It ensures the result of the `Build` function call is a `BadValueError` pointer and returns it.

1. **Severity**: 7/10

   **Line Number**: 70

   **Bug Type**: GDPR

   **Description**: The function 'ValueExpired' processes personal data (name) without explicit consent or checks for consent, which is a violation of GDPR.

   **Solution**: Ensure that explicit user consent is gained before processing personal data, or check that consent has already been given.


2. **Severity**: 6/10

   **Line Number**: 70

   **Bug Type**: HIPAA

   **Description**: The function 'ValueExpired' processes data without checking if it's health-related or not, potentially leading to Protected Health Information (PHI) being processed in violation of HIPAA.

   **Solution**: Implement checks to determine if the data being processed is PHI. If it is, ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect it.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 4:43:11 PM PDT

This is a function in the Go programming language. It belongs to a method set of a type `BadValueError`. The function is named `WithReason` and it takes a single argument `reason` of type `string`. It returns a pointer to a `BadValueError`.

The function `WithReason` is a method on the `BadValueError` type. This suggests that `BadValueError` is a custom error type in the codebase, possibly used to represent errors that occur when a bad or invalid value is encountered.

Inside the function, it calls a method `AddAttribute` on the `BadValueError` instance (`bve`). The `AddAttribute` method is likely a method that adds some metadata to the error. In this case, it's adding a "reason" attribute, which provides more context about why the error occurred. 

The `AddAttribute` method is called with two arguments: `reasonAttributeKey` and `reason`. The `reasonAttributeKey` is presumably a constant or variable defined elsewhere in the code that serves as the key for the reason attribute. The `reason` is the actual reason for the error, passed into the `WithReason` function.

The `AddAttribute` method returns an `error` interface, which is then cast to a pointer to a `BadValueError`. This is safe because the original type of the error was `BadValueError`. If the type assertion was not true, this would panic at runtime. However, since the method is called on a `BadValueError` instance, we can be confident that the type assertion will hold.

Finally, the function returns the modified `BadValueError`.

This function is a common pattern in Go for adding context to errors. It allows you to attach additional information to an error, which can be very useful for debugging.

1. **Severity**: 3/10

   **Line Number**: 76

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The method `WithReason` creates a new `BadValueError` object every time it is called. If this method is called in a loop or frequently, it could lead to high memory usage.

   **Solution**: Consider reusing the `BadValueError` object if possible, or redesign the method to avoid creating a new object every time. This could be done by making `reason` a field of `BadValueError` and setting it directly, rather than creating a new object with the `AddAttribute` method.

1. **Severity**: 7/10

   **Line Number**: 79

   **Bug Type**: Data Privacy

   **Description**: The function `WithReason` adds an attribute to the `BadValueError` object that could potentially contain sensitive information. If the `reason` string contains personal data, this could lead to a violation of data privacy regulations such as GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.

   **Solution**: Ensure that no personal data is included in the `reason` string. If necessary, implement a sanitization step to remove or obfuscate personal data before it is added to the `BadValueError` object.
