### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:01:04 PM PDT

This code is written in Go and is part of a package named `structs`. It imports several packages including `fmt`, `reflect`, `regexp`, `strings`, and a custom package `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr`.

The function `ExpressionApplierProvider` is declared with three parameters: an unnamed parameter of type `reflect.Type`, `sf` of type `reflect.StructField`, and `directive` of type `string`. The function returns two values: an `Applier` interface and a `Gomerr` interface from the `gomerr` package.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. The function first checks if the `directive` is an empty string. If it is, the function immediately returns `nil` for both the `Applier` and `Gomerr` interfaces.

2. It then checks if the second character of the `directive` is a dot (`.`). If it is, it returns a `StructApplier` with the `directive` as a parameter, and `nil` for the `Gomerr`.

3. If the second character of the `directive` is not a dot, it calls the function `GetToolFunction` with the `directive` as a parameter. This function seems to be responsible for retrieving a tool function based on the `directive`.

4. If `GetToolFunction` returns `nil`, it means the requested tool function was not found. In this case, the function returns `nil` for the `Applier` and a `Gomerr` error indicating that the field function was not found.

5. If `GetToolFunction` does return a function, `ExpressionApplierProvider` returns this function as the `Applier` and `nil` for the `Gomerr`.

The function uses reflection, which is a powerful feature in Go that allows a program to inspect and manipulate its own structure and behavior at runtime. Reflection is used here to dynamically apply validation or other operations to struct fields based on the `directive` provided.

For more information about reflection in Go, you can refer to this article: [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection) from the official Go blog.

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:10:41 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 7/10

   **Line Number**: 19

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The GetToolFunction function is called without any checks. If the directive is not found, it will result in wasted CPU cycles.

   **Solution**: Before calling the GetToolFunction, add a check to ensure the directive exists. This will prevent unnecessary function calls and improve CPU performance.


2. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 13

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The directive[1] == '.' operation is used without checking the length of the directive. If the directive is empty or has only one character, it will cause an out-of-range panic.

   **Solution**: Before accessing the directive's second character, ensure that the length of the directive is at least 2. This will prevent potential out-of-range panics and improve stability.


3. **Severity**: 4/10

   **Line Number**: 19

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: Repeated string concatenation using the '+' operator in Go can lead to inefficient memory usage as it can potentially create many temporary strings.

   **Solution**: Use the fmt.Sprintf function or strings.Builder to concatenate strings in a more memory-efficient way.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:01:40 PM PDT

The code defines a function named `ScopeAlias` in Go programming language. The function is designed to allow the caller to specify an alternative value to use when defining scoped configuration from the scope used during the application of a tool. 

The function accepts two parameters: `alias` and `scope`, both of which are strings. The function doesn't return any value.

Here is the detailed explanation of the code:

1. The function first checks if the `scope` variable is an empty string. If it is, the function deletes the `alias` from the `scopeAliases` map and returns immediately. This suggests that `scopeAliases` is a map where the keys are aliases and the values are scopes. The `delete` function is a built-in function in Go that removes the entry from the map for the given key.

2. If the `scope` is not an empty string, the function checks if the `alias` is already present in the `scopeAliases` map and if it is, whether its current value is different from the new `scope` value. If these conditions are met, the function panics with a formatted error message. This is done using the `panic` function, which is a built-in function in Go that stops the ordinary flow of a program and begins panicking. 

3. If the `alias` is not present in the `scopeAliases` map or its current value is the same as the new `scope` value, the function sets the `alias` in the `scopeAliases` map to the new `scope` value.

The algorithm used here is quite straightforward - it's basically a map manipulation algorithm, where the map is used as a dictionary to store key-value pairs and the function provides a way to add or remove entries from it.

This function is part of a larger system, and its purpose is to manage aliasing of scopes. This could be part of a configuration management system, where scopes are used to define different configuration contexts and aliases can be used to provide alternative names for these contexts.

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:09:34 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 69

   **Bug Type**: Improper Error Handling

   **Description**: The code uses panic() to handle an error condition. This is not a recommended practice as it abruptly terminates the program, which can lead to denial of service if the error is triggered by an attacker. It also discloses information about the system's state, which can aid an attacker in further exploitation.

   **Solution**: Replace panic() with proper error handling. Return an error to the caller, and let the caller decide how to handle the error. This can be done using Go's built-in error handling functionality. More information can be found here: https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go

1. **Severity**: 2/10

   **Line Number**: 69

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The use of panic() can be costly in terms of CPU usage as it involves stack unwinding.

   **Solution**: Avoid using panic for normal error handling. Use error returns instead.


2. **Severity**: 3/10

   **Line Number**: 69

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The use of fmt.Sprintf() can be memory-intensive, especially if the strings involved are large.

   **Solution**: Consider using string concatenation or a buffer if performance is a concern and the strings are large.


3. **Severity**: 1/10

   **Line Number**: 71

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: Assigning values to a map can increase memory usage.

   **Solution**: Ensure that the map is not unnecessarily large and that values are removed when no longer needed.

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:15:01 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 2/10

   **Line Number**: 68

   **Bug Type**: Data Compliance

   **Description**: The function `ScopeAlias` does not perform any input validation on the `alias` and `scope` parameters. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which are violations of GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.

   **Solution**: Implement input validation for the `alias` and `scope` parameters to ensure they are in the expected format and do not contain malicious code. Use a library or framework that provides built-in functions for input validation.


2. **Severity**: 4/10

   **Line Number**: 71

   **Bug Type**: Data Compliance

   **Description**: The function `ScopeAlias` uses a panic in case of an error. This could lead to the application crashing and potentially exposing sensitive information in error messages, which would be a violation of GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.

   **Solution**: Replace the panic with proper error handling. Return an error to the caller of the function and handle it appropriately, ensuring that no sensitive information is exposed in error messages.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:02:08 PM PDT

The provided code snippet is a function written in Go, a statically typed, compiled language developed by Google. The function is named `ScopeAliases` and it accepts a single argument: `aliasToScope`, which is a map where both keys and values are strings.

The function iterates over the `aliasToScope` map using a `for` loop. In each iteration, it extracts the key-value pair from the map. The key is referred to as `alias` and the value is referred to as `scope`. For each of these key-value pairs, it calls another function named `ScopeAlias` with `alias` and `scope` as arguments. 

The `ScopeAlias` function is not defined in the provided code, but based on its usage, it can be inferred that it's a function that takes two string arguments and does something with them, possibly associating the alias with the scope in some way.

The algorithm employed in this code is a simple iteration over a map data structure. This is a common pattern in many programming languages and doesn't involve any complex algorithms.

The code is straightforward and seems to be consistent with general Go programming practices. It doesn't appear to conflict with any standard architectural guidelines. However, without additional context or information about the `ScopeAlias` function and the overall project, it's hard to provide a more detailed analysis.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:02:51 PM PDT

The provided code is written in Go language and it appears to be part of a larger system responsible for applying constraints or directives based on certain scopes. 

It uses regular expressions and reflection, which is a mechanism that allows a program to inspect and manipulate its own structure and behavior at runtime.

The main function, `applyScopes()`, takes in four arguments: an `ApplierProvider`, a `reflect.Type` representing the type of a struct, a `reflect.StructField` representing a field in that struct, and a directive string.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. The `applyScopes()` function is used to apply directives to a struct based on the scope. The function takes a string of directives, which are expected to be in a specific format: `[<scope>:]<tool_config>[;[<scope>:]<tool_config>]]*`. The function will apply the specified tool configuration to the fields in the struct that match the given scope.

2. The function begins by creating an empty map of `Applier` objects, which will eventually be filled with the appropriate `Applier` for each scope found in the directive string.

3. The function then uses a regular expression to parse the directive string and find all matches. For each match, it retrieves the scope and the directive for that scope.

4. If a scope is not provided, it defaults to a wildcard scope, represented by `anyScope`. If the scope is an alias, it is replaced with the actual scope.

5. The function then creates an `Applier` for the scope and directive. If an error occurs during this process, it is returned along with the scope as an attribute.

6. If an `Applier` was successfully created, it is added to the map of `Applier` objects. If no `Applier` was created and the scope is not the wildcard scope, a `NoApplier` object is added to the map.

7. Finally, the function returns the appropriate `Applier` based on the number of `Applier` objects in the map. If there are no `Applier` objects, it returns `nil`. If there is only one `Applier` and it is for the wildcard scope, it is returned directly. Otherwise, a `scopeSelect` object containing the map of `Applier` objects is returned.

This function is an example of the Strategy pattern, where different strategies (in this case, `Applier` objects) can be selected at runtime based on certain conditions (in this case, the scope).

For more information on Go's reflection package, you can refer to [Go's official documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/). For more information on regular expressions in Go, you can refer to [Go's regexp package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/).

1. **Severity**: 7/10

   **Line Number**: 124

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The use of regular expressions can be CPU-intensive, especially in a loop where it's being compiled on each iteration.

   **Solution**: Compile the regular expression once and reuse it. If the regular expression is not changing, it should be compiled once and stored in a variable for reuse.


2. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 124

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The use of FindAllStringSubmatch can lead to increased memory usage as it returns all matches, which can be large depending on the input.

   **Solution**: Consider using FindStringSubmatch if only the first match is needed. If all matches are needed, ensure that the input size is controlled.


3. **Severity**: 4/10

   **Line Number**: 135

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The use of strings.ReplaceAll in a loop can be CPU-intensive, especially if the string is large.

   **Solution**: If the string is not changing, consider replacing it once and storing the result for reuse. If the string is changing, consider whether the replace operation is necessary on each iteration.


4. **Severity**: 6/10

   **Line Number**: 141

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: Creating a new map in each iteration can lead to increased memory usage.

   **Solution**: Consider reusing the map if possible, or using a data structure that does not require creating a new map in each iteration.

This is a simple piece of Go code that defines a struct named `scopeSelect`. This struct has one field, `appliers`, which is a map where the keys are strings and the values are of type `Applier`. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `type`: This keyword is used to define a new type. In this case, we are defining a new struct type named `scopeSelect`.

- `scopeSelect`: This is the name of the new struct type being defined.

- `struct`: This keyword is used to define a struct. A struct in Go is a composite data type, which groups together zero or more values of different types. It's a way of creating a data structure that can hold different kinds of data.

- `appliers`: This is the name of the field in the `scopeSelect` struct. Each instance of `scopeSelect` will have this field.

- `map[string]Applier`: This is the type of the `appliers` field. It's a map where the keys are strings (`string`) and the values are of type `Applier`. A map in Go is a built-in associative data type that is used to store key-value pairs.

The `Applier` type is not defined in this code snippet, so it's not clear what it is. It could be a struct, an interface, or any other type in Go. It's likely defined elsewhere in the codebase.

This code does not contain any algorithms, it's just a type definition. 

As far as architectural guidelines, this code seems to be consistent with typical Go practices. It's defining a struct with a map field, which is a common way of creating data structures in Go. 

I cannot provide any specific architectural conflicts without more context or guidelines.

1. **Severity**: 3/10

   **Line Number**: 222

   **Bug Type**: Data Privacy

   **Description**: The 'scopeSelect' struct uses a map to store 'Applier' objects, which might be handling sensitive data. If not properly managed, this could lead to data leaks or unauthorized access.

   **Solution**: Ensure that all data stored in 'Applier' objects is encrypted and that access to the 'scopeSelect' struct is controlled. Use secure methods to manage sensitive data in memory.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:03:46 PM PDT

The provided code is a method written in Go programming language, which is part of a struct named `scopeSelect`. This struct is not shown in the code snippet, but it appears to be a part of a system that manages scopes in some way, possibly related to data validation or error handling. 

The `Apply` method takes three arguments:

1. `sv` of type `reflect.Value`: This is likely a source value that needs to be processed or validated.
2. `fv` of type `reflect.Value`: This could be a field value where the source value needs to be applied.
3. `tc` of type pointer to `ToolContext`: This is likely a context object that holds state or other data relevant to the current operation.

The `Apply` method returns a `gomerr.Gomerr`. `gomerr` is a package for error handling in Go. `Gomerr` is likely a custom error type defined in this package.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the method:

1. It attempts to retrieve a scopedApplier from a map (`s.appliers`) using the current scope as the key (`tc.Scope()`).

2. If it doesn't find a scopedApplier for the current scope (`ok` is false), it tries to get a default scopedApplier using a key `anyScope`.

3. If it still doesn't find a scopedApplier (`ok` is still false), it returns `nil`, indicating no error.

4. If it does find a scopedApplier (either for the current scope or the default one), it calls the `Apply` method on the scopedApplier with the same arguments that were passed in, and returns the result.

The algorithm used here is a simple map lookup with a fallback to a default value. This is a common pattern in Go when you want to handle a default case when a specific key is not found in a map.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:04:39 PM PDT

This code snippet is written in Go programming language. It defines a function named `Composite` that checks for a composition directive in a string and, if found, creates a composed `Applier` based on the specified semantic. If there isn't a composition directive, the function returns `nil` for both `Applier` and `gomerr.Gomerr`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. The function `Composite` takes four parameters:
   - `directive`: a string that presumably contains a composition directive (either '?' or '&').
   - `tool`: a pointer to an object of type `Tool`.
   - `st`: a `reflect.Type` object representing the static type of the struct.
   - `sf`: a `reflect.StructField` object representing a field in the struct.

2. The function first checks if the `directive` string starts with "if(" and ends with ')'. If it does, the function does nothing (as indicated by the TODO comment) and continues to the next step.

3. The function then finds the index of the first occurrence of '?' or '&' in the `directive` string. If neither character is found, the function returns `nil` for both `Applier` and `gomerr.Gomerr`.

4. If '?' or '&' is found, the function splits the `directive` string into a left-hand side (lhs) and a right-hand side (rhs) based on the index of '?' or '&'. It then tries to apply scopes to both sides using the `applyScopes` function.

5. If applying scopes to either side results in an error that isn't a `gomerr.ConfigurationError`, the function wraps the error in a `gomerr.Configuration` error with a message indicating that it was unable to process the directive.

6. If there are errors from applying scopes to either side, or if both left and right `Applier` are `nil`, the function returns `nil` for `Applier` and the batched errors for `gomerr.Gomerr`.

7. The function then defines a test function `testFn` based on whether the composition directive is '?' or '&'. If it's '?', `testFn` returns true if the value is not zero. If it's '&', `testFn` always returns false.

8. Finally, the function returns an `Applier` in the form of a `leftTestRightApplier` struct, which presumably tests a value using `testFn` and applies the left or right `Applier` based on the result of the test.

The function uses the `strings` and `reflect` packages from the Go standard library, and the `gomerr` package for error handling, which seems to be a custom package in the project.

1. **Severity**: 3/10

   **Line Number**: 250

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The function Composite uses the function strings.HasPrefix and strings.IndexAny for string manipulation. These operations are not CPU-intensive, but if this function is called in a tight loop, it may lead to increased CPU usage.

   **Solution**: If the function is called frequently, consider optimizing the string operations. For example, you could avoid calling strings.HasPrefix and strings.IndexAny multiple times by storing their results in variables.


2. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 262

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The function applyScopes is called twice within the function Composite. If applyScopes is CPU-intensive, this could lead to high CPU usage.

   **Solution**: Consider optimizing the applyScopes function if it is CPU-intensive, or if possible, call it once and reuse the result.


3. **Severity**: 4/10

   **Line Number**: 287

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The function Composite creates a new function testFn every time it's called. If this function is called frequently, this could lead to high memory usage.

   **Solution**: Consider defining the function testFn outside of the Composite function to avoid creating a new function every time Composite is called.

The provided code is a Go language function that is currently commented out. It is a method named `ifApplier` on a struct type `Tool`. This method returns two values, an `Applier` and a `Gomerr`.

The `ifApplier` method takes three parameters:

- `st` of type `reflect.Type`: This is a type from the `reflect` package in Go, which represents the type of a Go object. Reflection in Go is a powerful feature that allows a program to manipulate objects with arbitrary types.

- `sf` of type `reflect.StructField`: This is also from the `reflect` package and represents a field in a struct type.

- `directive` of type `string`: This could be any string value.

The method returns two values:

- An `Applier` which could be an interface or a struct type. Without more context, it's hard to say what this type does, but based on the name it likely has something to do with applying changes or operations.

- A `Gomerr`: This is likely a custom error type from the `gomerr` package. The `gomerr` package is not part of the standard Go library, so it's probably a third-party package or something defined elsewhere in this project. Given the name, it's likely used for handling errors in a specific way.

The function body is currently empty (it immediately returns `nil, nil`), meaning it doesn't do anything at the moment.

The code snippet you provided is written in Go language and it defines a struct called `ifThenElseApplier`. This struct is a data structure that contains four fields: `name`, `test`, `then`, and `orElse`.

Here's a breakdown of each field:

1. `name`: This is a string field that likely represents the name of the `ifThenElseApplier` instance.

2. `test`: This is a function field that takes a `reflect.Value` as an argument and returns a boolean value. `reflect.Value` is a struct from the `reflect` package in Go, which provides a way to inspect, modify and create any Go value. The `test` function will likely be used to perform some kind of condition check on a value.

3. `then`: This is a field of type `Applier`. `Applier` is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it's likely to be an interface or a function type that is defined elsewhere in the codebase. The `then` field will likely be used to apply some kind of operation if the `test` function returns `true`.

4. `orElse`: This is another field of type `Applier`, similar to the `then` field. It will likely be used to apply a different operation if the `test` function returns `false`.

The `ifThenElseApplier` struct seems to be implementing a form of the "Strategy Pattern", where you select an algorithm at runtime. In this case, the algorithm is either the `then` or `orElse` function, depending on the result of the `test` function.

This struct could be used to apply a different operation to a value based on some condition. The `test` function checks the condition, and then either the `then` or `orElse` function is applied to the value.

For more information on the Strategy Pattern, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Strategy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)
- [Design patterns in Golang: Strategy](https://medium.com/@george.b.lopez/design-patterns-in-golang-strategy-57a4e3b1e0e0)

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:06:28 PM PDT

The code snippet you've provided is a commented out function in Go. It's not possible to provide a complete analysis on this function as it's commented out and doesn't contain any logic. However, I can explain what the function could potentially do based on its signature.

The function is named `Apply` and it's a method of a struct or an interface named `ifThenElseApplier`. 

The function takes three parameters:

1. `sv`: This parameter is of type `reflect.Value`. The `reflect` package in Go provides a way to inspect the type and value of variables at runtime. `reflect.Value` represents the value of a variable.

2. `fv`: This parameter is also of type `reflect.Value`. It seems like this function might be working with two different values that it needs to compare or manipulate in some way.

3. `tc`: This parameter is a pointer to a `ToolContext` type. Without additional context, it's hard to say what `ToolContext` exactly is, but it's probably a struct or an interface that contains some context or configuration for the tool that's being used.

The function returns a value of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. `gomerr` is likely a package used for handling errors in this project. The `Gomerr` type is probably a custom error type that provides additional information about errors that can occur in this project.

The function itself is currently empty, as denoted by the `{}`. All the code inside the function has been commented out.

In terms of architectural guidelines, this function seems to follow common Go practices. It uses the `reflect` package for working with variables at runtime, and it uses a custom error type for handling errors, which can provide more flexibility and information than Go's built-in error type.

For more information on the topics mentioned, you can refer to the following resources:

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:07:06 PM PDT

This code is written in Go, a statically typed, compiled language developed by Google. The code snippet defines a new data type, `leftTestRightApplier`, which is a struct, Go's complex data type that groups together zero or more values of different types. 

The `leftTestRightApplier` struct has four fields:

1. `name`: This is a string field. In Go, a string is a sequence of characters with a definite length, used to represent text.

2. `left`: This is of type `Applier`. `Applier` is not a built-in Go data type, so it must be a custom type defined elsewhere in your code. Without more context, it's hard to say exactly what `Applier` is, but by its name, it seems to be an interface or a struct that applies some operation.

3. `test`: This is a function field. In Go, functions can be assigned to variables and passed around just like other values. This function takes a `reflect.Value` as input and returns a boolean. `reflect.Value` is a type from the `reflect` package in Go's standard library, which provides a way to inspect the type and value of variables at runtime. This `test` function presumably performs some kind of test on a `reflect.Value` and returns `true` or `false` based on the result.

4. `right`: This is another `Applier` type field. 

The `leftTestRightApplier` struct might be used to represent some kind of rule or operation that has a left side, a test, and a right side. Depending on the outcome of the test, different operations (represented by `Applier` instances) could be applied.

Without more context, it's hard to identify the specific algorithms used in this code, as it's just a data type definition. However, it's clear that this code uses concepts like data structuring, function passing, and runtime reflection, which are all key aspects of Go programming.

1. **Severity**: 2/10

   **Line Number**: 374

   **Bug Type**: Data Exposure

   **Description**: The 'leftTestRightApplier' struct does not implement any form of data protection or encryption, which could potentially expose sensitive data if instances of this struct are transmitted or stored insecurely.

   **Solution**: Consider implementing encryption or other forms of data protection for sensitive fields within the 'leftTestRightApplier' struct. For example, sensitive fields could be encrypted before they are stored and decrypted when they are needed for processing. If the struct is being transmitted, consider using secure transmission protocols to protect the data during transit.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Thursday, September 7, 2023 at 5:07:51 PM PDT

This code is written in Go and it's a method of a struct called `leftTestRightApplier`. The purpose of this method is to apply some operations (represented by the `left` and `right` fields of the struct) to the provided values (`sv` and `fv`), and return an error if any operation fails.

The `leftTestRightApplier` struct has three fields:
- `left`: a pointer to another applier that will be applied before the test.
- `test`: a test function that will be executed if the `left` applier succeeds.
- `right`: a pointer to another applier that will be applied after the test.

The `Apply` method works as follows:

1. If the `left` applier is not `nil`, it is applied to `sv` and `fv`. If this operation fails (i.e., returns a non-nil error), the error is stored in `leftGe`.

2. If `leftGe` is `nil` (i.e., the `left` applier succeeded or was not present) and the test function returns `true` when applied to `fv`, the method returns `nil`, indicating success.

3. If the test function fails or the `left` applier fails, the method proceeds to the `right` applier. If the `right` applier is `nil`, the method returns `leftGe` (which may be `nil` if the `left` applier was not present).

4. If the `right` applier is not `nil`, it is applied to `sv` and `fv`. If this operation fails, the method returns a batch error containing the error from the `right` applier and `leftGe` (which may be `nil`).

5. If the `right` applier succeeds but `leftGe` is not `nil` (i.e., the `left` applier failed but the `right` applier succeeded), a message is printed to the console. This is likely for debugging purposes, as indicated by the `TODO` comment.

6. Finally, if the `right` applier succeeds and `leftGe` is `nil`, the method returns `nil`, indicating success.

The algorithm used here is a form of sequential processing, where each operation is applied in a specific order and the next operation depends on the success of the previous one. This is a common pattern in Go, especially in error handling.

The control flow graph above represents the control flow of the provided source code. The primary path is shown in green, while error paths are shown in red.

The control flow starts at the "Start" node and proceeds to check if the left value is null. If it is not null, the left applier is applied. If the left applier returns an error, the control flow proceeds to the "Left Error" node. If the left applier returns no error, the control flow proceeds to check the test condition.

If the test condition is true, the control flow proceeds to check if the right value is null. If it is not null, the right applier is applied. If the right applier returns an error, the control flow proceeds to the "Right Error" node. If the right applier returns no error, the control flow proceeds to the "End" node.

If the test condition is false, the control flow proceeds directly to the "Left Error" node.

If the left applier returns an error and the right applier returns no error, the control flow proceeds to the "Batch errors" node, where the errors are batched. The control flow then returns to the "Start" node.

If the left applier returns no error and the right applier returns an error, the control flow proceeds to the "Left Error" node, where the left error is printed. The control flow then returns to the "Start" node.

If both the left applier and the right applier return no error, the control flow proceeds directly to the "End" node.

If the left value is null, the control flow proceeds directly to the "End" node.

Note: The control flow graph assumes that the "left", "test", and "right" variables are defined and initialized correctly.

1. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 388

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The function uses reflection which is computationally expensive and can slow down performance.

   **Solution**: Minimize the use of reflection where possible. Consider using interfaces or type assertions if applicable. You can find more information here: https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection


2. **Severity**: 3/10

   **Line Number**: 398

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The function uses fmt.Println for debug logging which is not performant and can slow down the application.

   **Solution**: Use a logging library designed for performance and flexibility, such as logrus or zerolog. More details can be found here: https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus and https://github.com/rs/zerolog


3. **Severity**: 4/10

   **Line Number**: 396

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The function uses gomerr.Batch which creates a new error object. If this function is called frequently, it could lead to high memory consumption.

   **Solution**: Consider using error wrapping instead of batching errors to reduce memory usage. More information on error wrapping in Go can be found here: https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors
