HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web site servers on the Internet. They help identify the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource does not load properly.\n\nThe constant `StatusLimitExceeded` is defined with a value of 402. This is not a standard HTTP status code. The standard codes range from 100 to 599 and each code has a specific meaning. For example, 200 means \"OK\", 404 means \"Not Found\", etc. The code 402 is reserved for future use and is not officially used yet.\n\nThe interface `StatusCoder` is defined with a single method `StatusCode() int`. This interface can be implemented by any type that needs to provide an HTTP status code. The method `StatusCode` should return an integer representing an HTTP status code. \n\nThis kind of interface is commonly used in Go to provide a way to handle HTTP responses in a consistent manner. Any type that implements `StatusCoder` can be used where an HTTP status code is needed, providing flexibility and consistency.\n\nThe algorithm used here is extremely simple. It's just a definition of a constant and an interface. There is no complex logic or computation involved.\n\nFor more information on HTTP status codes, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)\n- [Go interfaces](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9)"
