It also includes authentication and authorization components. The project is written in Go and follows a modular and structured approach, which is consistent with best practices for Go server applications.\n\nHowever, the analysis has identified several issues related to data compliance, particularly GDPR and HIPAA, in the `auth/subject.go` file. These issues could potentially impact the overall project, especially if the file is central to the application's functionality.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issues could potentially lead to non-compliance with GDPR and HIPAA regulations, which could result in legal and financial penalties for the company. It could also lead to a loss of customer trust if personal data is not handled correctly.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe analysis has identified 2 GDPR and 2 HIPAA warnings, and 1 Data Privacy warning in the `auth/subject.go` file. These issues need to be addressed to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nGiven that the `auth/subject.go` file is the only file in the project, 100% of the project files have been identified with issues. This indicates a high risk level for the project, and immediate action is required to address these issues.\n\n### Highlights\n\n1. **Architectural Consistency**: The project follows a modular and structured approach, which is consistent with best practices for Go server applications. This is a positive aspect of the project as it facilitates maintainability and scalability.\n\n2. **Data Compliance Issues**: The `auth/subject.go` file has several data compliance issues related to GDPR and HIPAA. This is a major concern as non-compliance could lead to legal and financial penalties.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The identified issues could lead to a loss of customer trust if personal data is not handled correctly. This could potentially impact the company's reputation and customer base.\n\n4. **Risk Level**: Given that 100% of the project files have issues, the risk level for the project is high. Immediate action is required to address these issues.\n\n5. **No Additional Architectural Guidelines**: The project does not have any additional special architectural guidelines or constraints. This provides flexibility in choosing the best approach to address the identified issues.",
