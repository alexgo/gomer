Within this package, an interface named `Store` is declared with five methods: `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`, and `Query`. Each of these methods accepts a different type of parameter and returns an object of type `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\nThe `Store` interface provides a blueprint for data storage operations that can be implemented by any type that satisfies this interface. This is a common pattern in Go and is used to provide a consistent API for different types of data stores, such as in-memory stores, file-based stores, or database stores.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the `Store` interface:\n\n- `Create(p Persistable) gomerr.Gomerr`: This method is expected to create a new entry in the data store. The entry to be created is represented by the `Persistable` parameter. The method returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` which is a custom error type from the `gomerr` package.\n\n- `Read(p Persistable) gomerr.Gomerr`: This method is expected to read an entry from the data store. The entry to be read is represented by the `Persistable` parameter. The method returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` which is a custom error type from the `gomerr` package.\n\n- `Update(p Persistable, update Persistable) gomerr.Gomerr`: This method is expected to update an existing entry in the data store. The entry to be updated and the new data are represented by the `Persistable` parameters. The method returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` which is a custom error type from the `gomerr` package.\n\n- `Delete(p Persistable) gomerr.Gomerr`: This method is expected to delete an entry from the data store. The entry to be deleted is represented by the `Persistable` parameter. The method returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` which is a custom error type from the `gomerr` package.\n\n- `Query(q Queryable) gomerr.Gomerr`: This method is expected to perform a query on the data store. The query to be performed is represented by the `Queryable` parameter. The method returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` which is a custom error type from the `gomerr` package.\n\nThe `Persistable` and `Queryable` types are not defined in this code snippet, but they are likely interfaces or types that represent data objects and queries respectively.\n\nThe `gomerr` package is a custom package that provides enhanced error handling capabilities. More information about this package can be found at: https://github.com/jt0/gomer\n\nAs per the architectural guidelines provided, the code is consistent in terms of providing a generic interface for data storage operations. There is no conflict as the code does not impose any specific implementation, leaving it up to the concrete types that implement the `Store` interface."

The snippet defines an interface named `Persistable`. In Go, an interface is a custom type that sets a contract of methods that types implementing the interface should have. \n\nThe `Persistable` interface in this code defines two methods:\n\n1. `TypeName() string`: This method should return a string that is the type name of the object implementing this interface. This could be used in scenarios where you need to know the type of the object at runtime. \n\n2. `NewQueryable() Queryable`: This method should return a new instance of a `Queryable` type. `Queryable` is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it's presumably another interface or type defined elsewhere in the project. This method could be used in scenarios where you need to create a new `Queryable` object from an object implementing the `Persistable` interface.\n\nThe `Persistable` interface might be used in a data persistence layer of the software, where objects need to be saved and retrieved from a database. The `TypeName` could be used to determine the type of the object to be saved, and the `NewQueryable` method could be used to create a new query object for retrieving data.\n\nA key point to note is that interfaces in Go are implicitly implemented. This means that a type doesn't have to explicitly state that it implements an interface; it just needs to have the methods that the interface defines.\n\nFor more information on interfaces in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Interfaces in Go](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [A Tour of Go: Interfaces](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9)\n- [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)"
