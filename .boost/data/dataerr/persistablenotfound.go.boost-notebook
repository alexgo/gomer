The purpose of this package is to handle specialized errors related to data persistence. \n\nThe `import` statement imports a package named `gomerr` from the GitHub repository `github.com/jt0/gomer`. This package is a library for creating and managing errors in Go. It allows for rich error types and context, and is designed to be used with Go's built-in error handling mechanisms.\n\nThe code then defines a struct named `PersistableNotFoundError`. This struct is a type of error that can be used when a persistable data object is not found. It embeds the `Gomerr` struct from the `gomerr` package, inheriting its methods and properties, and adds two additional fields: `TypeName` and `Key`.\n\n- `TypeName` is a string that presumably represents the type of the persistable data object that was not found.\n- `Key` is an empty interface, meaning it can hold values of any type. This is likely the key used to look up the persistable data object.\n\nBy defining this custom error type, the software can provide more specific error information when a persistable data object is not found, and can handle this specific error type in a different way from other errors if necessary.\n\nThis code follows the Go best practice of defining custom error types for specific error conditions. It also uses composition by embedding the `Gomerr` type in the `PersistableNotFoundError` type, another common Go practice.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the Go blog post on the topic: [https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors). \n\nFor more information on the `gomerr` package, you can refer to its GitHub page: [https://github.com/jt0/gomer](https://github.com/jt0/gomer)."

This function is written in the Go programming language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the function:\n\n- The function `PersistableNotFound` takes two parameters: a string `typeName` and a generic `key` of type `interface{}`. The `interface{}` type in Go is a way to allow a function to accept any type of argument.\n\n- Inside the function, it calls `gomerr.Build` and passes it three parameters: a new instance of `PersistableNotFoundError`, `typeName`, and `key`. `gomerr` is likely a package in the project that deals with error handling, and `Build` is a function within that package. The `Build` function likely constructs a new error object with the provided parameters.\n\n- The `Build` function returns an instance of `gomerr.Error`, which is then type-asserted to `*PersistableNotFoundError` using the `.(*PersistableNotFoundError)` syntax. This is necessary because `Build` returns a generic `gomerr.Error`, but we want a specific `PersistableNotFoundError`.\n\n- Finally, the new `PersistableNotFoundError` instance is returned.\n\nThe function is a part of error handling in the software. The `PersistableNotFoundError` is likely used when a persistable object (an object that can be saved to a database) is not found. The `typeName` parameter is likely the name of the type of the persistable object, and `key` is likely the identifier used to search for the persistable object.\n\nThe algorithm used here is straightforward: create a new `PersistableNotFoundError`, populate it with the given details, and return it.\n\nAs for architectural guidelines, this function seems to follow standard Go error handling practices. It uses a custom error type (`PersistableNotFoundError`) to provide more context about the error, which can be useful for debugging and logging.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post on the topic: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)."
