The code defines a package called `dataerr`. This package seems to be a part of a larger project, likely a server-side application (based on the import statements). \n\nThis package appears to be concerned with error handling related to data operations, especially when a key-value pair is not found.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. **Import statements:** The code imports two packages from the project itself - `github.com/jt0/gomer/data` and `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr`. The `data` package likely contains definitions and operations for data handling in the application. The `gomerr` package is probably a custom error handling package, providing a base error type `Gomerr`.\n\n2. **KeyValueNotFoundError struct:** This struct is a custom error type defined in this package. It embeds the `Gomerr` type, meaning it inherits the behavior of `Gomerr` and can add more fields or methods. The `KeyValueNotFoundError` has three fields:\n\n   - `KeyName`: This is likely the name of the key that was not found.\n   - `KeyFields`: This could be the fields related to the key that was not found.\n   - `Persistable`: This is of type `data.Persistable` (from the imported `data` package). The `gomerr:\"include_type\"` tag suggests that when this error is reported, the type of the `Persistable` should be included in the error message.\n\nThe code doesn't contain any algorithms as such. It's more of a type definition for a specific kind of error in the application.\n\nFor more on error handling in Go, you can refer to [this link](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors).\n\nFor understanding more about Go and its struct types, [this link](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/2) can be helpful.\n\nIn terms of architectural guidelines, the code appears to follow good practices. It encapsulates the error handling related to data operations in a separate package (`dataerr`), and defines a specific error type (`KeyValueNotFoundError`) for a common error scenario. This makes the error handling more modular and easier to manage."

This particular function `KeyValueNotFound` is used to create a new instance of `KeyValueNotFoundError` when a key-value pair is not found in the data store. \n\nThe function takes three arguments:\n- `keyName`: a string that represents the name of the key.\n- `keyFields`: a slice of strings that represents the fields of the key.\n- `persistable`: an interface of type `data.Persistable` which represents the object that is persistable to the data store.\n\nThe function returns a pointer to a newly created `KeyValueNotFoundError`.\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n1. `gomerr.Build(new(KeyValueNotFoundError), keyName, keyFields, persistable)`: This statement is used to build a new error of type `KeyValueNotFoundError`. The `Build` function is a method from the `gomerr` package, which is a common error handling package in Go. This function takes a variable number of arguments. The first argument must be a pointer to a new error (in this case `KeyValueNotFoundError`), and the rest of the arguments are used to populate the error fields.\n\n2. `.(*KeyValueNotFoundError)`: This is a type assertion in Go. It asserts that the result of `gomerr.Build` call is of type `*KeyValueNotFoundError`. If the assertion is true, it returns the error as `*KeyValueNotFoundError`. If the assertion is false, it will panic.\n\nIn summary, this function is used to create and return a new `KeyValueNotFoundError` when a key-value pair is not found in the data store. It uses the `Build` method from `gomerr` package to create the error and then uses a type assertion to return the error as `*KeyValueNotFoundError`.\n\nThe algorithm used here is pretty straightforward. It involves creating a new error and populating it with the provided arguments. The error handling mechanism used here is common in Go and is considered a good practice.\n\nFor more information about error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n- [Go: Best Practices for Production Environments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Production-Deployments)"
