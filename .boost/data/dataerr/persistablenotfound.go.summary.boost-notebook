The architecture adheres to Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, which promotes maintainability and scalability. However, the use of reflection in the `gomerr.Build` function, as found in the `data/dataerr/persistablenotfound.go` file, could potentially impact the CPU performance negatively.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with this project is relatively low. Only one file, `data/dataerr/persistablenotfound.go`, has been flagged with a warning related to CPU performance. This represents a small fraction of the overall project, suggesting that the majority of the codebase is free from severe issues. However, the impact on CPU performance should not be overlooked, especially if this function is called frequently.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The potential customer impact is minimal as the issue identified is a warning and not a critical error. However, if left unaddressed, the CPU performance issue could lead to slower response times, which could affect the user experience, especially for applications that heavily rely on this library for data validation and constraint handling.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The overall health of the project source is good, with only one file having a detected issue. This suggests that the codebase is generally well-written and follows good programming practices. However, the CPU performance warning should be addressed to ensure optimal performance.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\n- **Health of the Project Source**: The health of the project source is generally good. Only one file out of the entire project has a detected issue, indicating that the majority of the project files are free from severe issues. This suggests that the codebase is generally well-written and follows good programming practices.\n- **Percentage of Project Files with Issues**: Given the information provided, it appears that a small percentage of the project files have issues. This is based on the fact that only one file has been flagged with a warning. This suggests that the majority of the project files are free from severe issues.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project is a well-structured Go library focusing on constraint handling and validation.\n- Only one file, `data/dataerr/persistablenotfound.go`, has been flagged with a warning related to CPU performance.\n- The potential customer impact is minimal as the issue identified is a warning and not a critical error.\n- The overall health of the project source is good, with only one file having a detected issue.\n- Given the information provided, it appears that a small percentage of the project files have issues.",

It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, there is a potential GDPR violation in the function 'PersistableNotFound' which logs the key of the not found persistable. If the key contains personally identifiable information (PII), this could lead to unnecessary processing of personal data. This issue is found in the file 'data/dataerr/persistablenotfound.go'.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with this project is moderate. The potential GDPR violation could lead to legal and financial consequences if not addressed. The project has one file with issues out of one total file, indicating a 100% issue rate. This high issue rate suggests that there may be other, undetected issues in the project.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: If the GDPR violation is not addressed, customers could have their personal data unnecessarily processed. This could lead to a loss of trust in the product and potential legal action from customers.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has one file with issues out of one total file. The issue is a potential GDPR violation in the function 'PersistableNotFound'. This issue is of high severity and needs to be addressed immediately.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\nThe overall health of the project source is concerning. With a 100% issue rate, there is a high risk of undetected issues in the project. The potential GDPR violation is of high severity and could have significant legal and financial consequences if not addressed.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- There is a potential GDPR violation in the function 'PersistableNotFound' which logs the key of the not found persistable.\n- The project has one file with issues out of one total file, indicating a 100% issue rate.\n- The potential GDPR violation could lead to legal and financial consequences if not addressed.\n- With a 100% issue rate, there is a high risk of undetected issues in the project.",
