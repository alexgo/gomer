The project structure seems consistent with Go server applications. Error handling and data validation appear to be well-structured. However, the use of reflection in the `gomerr.Build` function can be computationally expensive, particularly if this function is called frequently. This could potentially impact the CPU performance of the application.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis:** The risk associated with this project is moderate. The use of reflection in the `gomerr.Build` function could potentially lead to performance issues if not addressed. However, this is a manageable risk as it can be mitigated by using a more direct approach to error handling, such as returning a new instance of the error directly, without using reflection.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact:** The potential customer impact is low to moderate. If the performance issue is not addressed, it could lead to slower response times for the application, which could negatively impact the user experience. However, this risk can be mitigated by addressing the performance issue identified.\n\n4. **Overall Issues:** The overall issues for this software project are manageable. The main issue identified is the potential performance impact due to the use of reflection in the `gomerr.Build` function. However, this issue can be addressed by using a more direct approach to error handling.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\n- **Overall Health of the Project Source:** The overall health of the project source is good. Only one file was identified with a warning level issue. This suggests that the majority of the project files are free of detected issues.\n\n- **Percentage of Project Files with Issues:** Based on the provided data, approximately 100% of the project files have warning level issues. However, this is based on a single file, so the percentage may not accurately represent the overall health of the project.\n\nHighlights of the Analysis:\n\n1. The project follows a modular and structured approach, with a focus on data validation and error handling.\n2. The use of reflection in the `gomerr.Build` function could potentially impact the CPU performance of the application.\n3. The risk associated with this project is moderate, but manageable.\n4. The potential customer impact is low to moderate, depending on how the performance issue is addressed.\n5. The overall health of the project source is good, with the majority of the project files free of detected issues.",

It is written in Go and follows a modular and structured approach. The project structure is consistent with Go server applications, and it seems to follow best practices for structuring a Go server application. However, there is a potential GDPR violation in the 'PersistableNotFound' function in the 'data/dataerr/persistablenotfound.go' file. This function logs the key of the not found persistable, which could lead to unnecessary processing of personal data if the key contains personally identifiable information (PII).\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with this project is primarily related to data compliance. The potential GDPR violation could lead to legal and financial consequences if not addressed. The project also has a potential HIPAA violation in the same file, which could lead to additional legal and financial risks. \n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: If the potential GDPR and HIPAA violations are not addressed, customers' personal data could be at risk. This could lead to a loss of trust in the product and potential customer churn. \n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has one file with issues related to GDPR and HIPAA. This represents 100% of the project files, indicating that data compliance is a significant issue in this project. \n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: The overall health of the project source is concerning due to the potential GDPR and HIPAA violations. All the project files have issues of varying severity, with the most severe being a warning. This suggests that while the project follows best practices in terms of structure and design, there are significant issues related to data compliance that need to be addressed.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project follows a modular and structured approach, consistent with Go server applications.\n- There is a potential GDPR violation in the 'PersistableNotFound' function in the 'data/dataerr/persistablenotfound.go' file, which could lead to unnecessary processing of personal data.\n- The same file also has a potential HIPAA violation, indicating that data compliance is a significant issue in this project.\n- All the project files have issues of varying severity, with the most severe being a warning.\n- The potential GDPR and HIPAA violations could lead to legal and financial consequences, as well as a loss of trust from customers.",
