The project appears to be well-structured and follows Go's idiomatic style for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n\nHowever, there are some data compliance issues that have been identified in the project, specifically in the file `data/dataerr/keyvaluenotfound.go`. These issues relate to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance, and could potentially have a significant impact on the project if not addressed.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified data compliance issues could potentially impact customers who are subject to these regulations. If personal data is being logged or exposed unnecessarily, this could lead to violations of these regulations and potential legal and financial consequences for the customers.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe overall health of the project source appears to be good, with only one file out of the total project files having detected issues. However, the severity of these issues is high, and they should be addressed as soon as possible to mitigate potential risks.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nBased on the analysis, the risk level of the project is moderate. While the majority of the project files have no detected issues, the issues that have been detected are of high severity and relate to data compliance, which could potentially have significant legal and financial implications.\n\n### Highlights of the Analysis\n\n- The project is well-structured and follows Go's idiomatic style for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- Data compliance issues related to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS have been identified in the file `data/dataerr/keyvaluenotfound.go`.\n- These issues could potentially impact customers who are subject to these regulations, leading to potential legal and financial consequences.\n- The overall health of the project source appears to be good, with only one file out of the total project files having detected issues.\n- The risk level of the project is moderate due to the high severity of the detected issues and their potential implications.",
