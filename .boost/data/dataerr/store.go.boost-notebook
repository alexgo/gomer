This code is likely part of a larger data management or storage system, given the naming conventions used.\n\nLet's break down the code in detail:\n\n1. `package dataerr`: This line declares the package name as `dataerr`. All the code within this file is part of the `dataerr` package.\n\n2. `import (...)`: This is the import statement, which is used to include other packages in the code. In this case, it's importing the `gomerr` package from `github.com/jt0/gomer`. The `gomerr` package provides a flexible error handling mechanism for Go applications.\n\n3. `type StoreError struct {...}`: This line declares a new type `StoreError` which is a struct (a collection of fields). `StoreError` is an extension of the `Gomerr` type. This means that `StoreError` inherits all the properties and methods of `Gomerr`, but can also have additional fields. In this case, `StoreError` has two additional fields: `Operation` and `Data`.\n\n4. `Operation string`: This line declares a field named `Operation` of type string. This field likely stores information about the operation that caused the error.\n\n5. `Data interface{} `gomerr:\"include_type\"`: This line declares a field named `Data` of type `interface{}`. In Go, `interface{}` is the empty interface, which can hold values of any type. The `gomerr:\"include_type\"` tag is an instruction to the `gomerr` package to include the type of the `Data` value when the error is formatted.\n\nThe algorithm used in this code is straightforward: it defines a new type `StoreError` that extends the `Gomerr` type and adds two additional fields. There are no complex algorithms used in this code snippet.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to this link: [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n\nFor more information on the `Gomerr` package, you can refer to its GitHub page: [Gomerr GitHub](https://github.com/jt0/gomer)"

This function, `Store`, takes two parameters - `operation` of type `string` and `data` of type `interface{}`. The function returns a pointer to a `StoreError` type.\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n1. `func Store(operation string, data interface{}) *StoreError`: This is the function signature. The function is named `Store`, it accepts two parameters and returns a pointer to `StoreError`.\n\n2. `operation` is the first parameter of type `string`. This parameter likely represents some kind of operation that is being performed in the context of this function.\n\n3. `data` is the second parameter of type `interface{}`. `interface{}` in Go is a way to accept any type of data. This parameter is likely the data that is being processed or manipulated in the operation.\n\n4. `return gomerr.Build(new(StoreError), operation, data).(*StoreError)`: The function returns a value generated by `gomerr.Build()`. `gomerr` is likely a package or module that provides error handling capabilities. `Build()` is a function from `gomerr` that is used to construct a new error.\n\n    - `new(StoreError)` creates a new instance of `StoreError` type. This instance is passed to `gomerr.Build()` as the first argument.\n\n    - `operation` and `data` are passed to `gomerr.Build()` as the second and third arguments respectively. The `Build()` function likely uses these values to generate a detailed error message.\n\n    - `.(*StoreError)` is a type assertion in Go. It asserts that the value returned by `gomerr.Build()` is of type `*StoreError`.\n\nIn terms of algorithm, this function is relatively straightforward. It's essentially a wrapper around `gomerr.Build()` that constructs a new `StoreError` with the given operation and data.\n\nAs for architectural guidelines, this function seems to follow good practices. It's a simple, single-purpose function that relies on a separate module (`gomerr`) for error handling, which promotes separation of concerns.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)"
