The code snippet is defining a custom error type `NoIndexMatchError` in a package named `dataerr`. \n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. `package dataerr`: This line defines the package name as `dataerr`. In Go, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For example, the math/rand package comprises files that begin with the statement `package rand`.\n\n2. `import`: The `import` keyword is used to import other packages into the program. Here, two packages are being imported:\n   - `github.com/jt0/gomer/data`: It's likely this package provides data-related functionalities, such as data structures or data handling functions.\n   - `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr`: This package probably provides functionalities related to error handling. The `gomerr` package appears to be a custom error handling package developed by the same author.\n\n3. `type NoIndexMatchError struct`: This line defines a new type named `NoIndexMatchError` which is a struct. In Go, a struct is a collection of fields.\n\n4. `gomerr.Gomerr`: This line indicates that the `NoIndexMatchError` struct embeds the `Gomerr` type from the `gomerr` package. This means that `NoIndexMatchError` will inherit all the fields and methods of `Gomerr`.\n\n5. `AvailableIndexes map[string]interface{}`: This line defines a field `AvailableIndexes` in the `NoIndexMatchError` struct. The field is a map where keys are strings and values are of the interface{} type, which means it can hold values of any type.\n\n6. `Queryable data.Queryable 'gomerr:\"include_type\"'`: This line defines a field `Queryable` of type `data.Queryable` in the `NoIndexMatchError` struct. The `gomerr:\"include_type\"` part is a struct tag. In Go, struct tags are used to attach metadata to the fields of a struct. Here, it's likely that the `gomerr` package uses this tag to determine whether to include the type of the `Queryable` field when the `NoIndexMatchError` is formatted or logged.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this code doesn't present any. It's a definition of a data type, not a process or function that would involve an algorithm.\n\nFor more information about Go programming, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)\n- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)\n- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)"

This error object is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it's likely a custom error type defined elsewhere in the project.\n\nThe function body calls `gomerr.Build` to create a new instance of `NoIndexMatchError`. `gomerr` is a package for creating and managing errors in Go, providing a more structured approach to error handling. The `Build` function takes a variadic number of arguments, the first of which is expected to be a pointer to a new error instance. The remaining arguments are used to populate fields in the error instance.\n\nIn this case, `new(NoIndexMatchError)` creates a new instance of `NoIndexMatchError`, and `availableIndexes` and `queryable` are presumably used to populate fields in the error instance. The result of `gomerr.Build` is then cast to a pointer to `NoIndexMatchError` before being returned.\n\nThe name `NoIndexMatch` suggests that this function is used when no match is found between the available indexes and the queryable data. This could be part of a database or data storage abstraction layer, where `NoIndexMatchError` is used to signal that a requested operation could not be performed because no suitable index was found.\n\nAs for algorithms, this function doesn't appear to implement any specific algorithm. It's more of a utility function for creating a specific type of error.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Errors are values](https://blog.golang.org/errors-are-values)\n- [Go error handling best practices](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2014/10/error-handling-in-go-part-i.html)"
