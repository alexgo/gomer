It defines a `Constraint` interface and provides implementations for various constraint types. The code follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library. However, the project has a high-severity issue related to data compliance. The file `data/store.go` does not seem to include any mechanisms for user consent or data anonymization, which are key requirements under GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. This could potentially impact the architectural design of the project as it may require significant changes to ensure data compliance.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with this project is high due to the lack of data compliance mechanisms. This could potentially lead to legal issues if the software is used to process personal data. The risk is further increased by the fact that the issue is present in the `data/store.go` file, which suggests that it could be a central part of the project's functionality.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: Customers who use this library to process personal data could be at risk of non-compliance with data protection regulations. This could lead to fines and reputational damage. Furthermore, the lack of user consent mechanisms could potentially lead to a loss of trust among end users.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has one file, `data/store.go`, which has high-severity issues related to data compliance. This represents 100% of the project files. The issues are related to GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\nThe overall health of the project source is concerning due to the high-severity data compliance issues. All the project files (100%) have high-severity issues, which suggests that the project may require significant changes to ensure data compliance. The lack of user consent mechanisms and data anonymization features could potentially lead to legal issues and a loss of trust among end users. \n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project is a Go library focused on constraint handling and validation.\n- The project has high-severity data compliance issues related to GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.\n- The issues are present in the `data/store.go` file, which suggests that they could be central to the project's functionality.\n- Customers who use this library to process personal data could be at risk of non-compliance with data protection regulations.\n- All the project files (100%) have high-severity issues, indicating a significant risk.",
