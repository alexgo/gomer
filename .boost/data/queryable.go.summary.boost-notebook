It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, the file 'data/queryable.go' has been flagged with several data compliance issues, which could impact the overall architecture if not addressed.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The file 'data/queryable.go' has been flagged with several high-severity issues related to GDPR, Data Retention, Data Exposure, Data Usage Limitation, and Data Compliance. These issues pose a significant risk to the project, especially if the software is to be used in environments where data security and compliance are paramount. The project also has warnings related to PCI DSS and HIPAA, indicating potential risks in handling sensitive data.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: If the identified issues are not addressed, customers who use this library in their projects could face data compliance issues, especially those operating in regulated industries. This could lead to legal and financial repercussions for the customers, and damage the reputation of the project.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has one file, 'data/queryable.go', which has been flagged with several issues. This represents 100% of the project files having issues, indicating a need for a thorough review and remediation of the identified issues.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Given that all the project files have been flagged with issues, the overall health of the project source is at risk. The severity of the issues, particularly those related to data compliance, further exacerbates this risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project follows good architectural practices, the identified data compliance issues pose a significant risk to the project and its users. It is recommended that these issues be addressed promptly to ensure the project's health and its suitability for use in data-sensitive environments.",
