The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types.\n\nHowever, the analysis has identified several high-severity issues in the project, specifically in the `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go` file. These issues include insecure encryption, insecure data handling, insecure direct object references (IDOR), and insecure cryptographic storage. \n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issues could potentially impact the security of the data processed by the library, making it vulnerable to attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), where attackers could decrypt and manipulate the data. This could lead to data breaches, loss of customer trust, and potential legal implications.\n\n### Overall Issues for the Software Project\n\nThe project has a single file with multiple high-severity issues. This suggests that the project may have systemic issues with data security and encryption, which could potentially impact the entire project.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nGiven that the project consists of a single file, 100% of the project files have been identified with high-severity issues. This indicates a high risk to the overall health of the project source.\n\n### Highlights of the Analysis\n\n1. **Insecure Encryption**: The encryption context is set to nil during the encryption process in `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go`. This can potentially lead to weak encryption and make the system vulnerable to attacks like MITM.\n\n2. **Insecure Data Handling**: The `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go` file has been flagged for insecure data handling. This could potentially lead to data breaches if not addressed.\n\n3. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: The `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go` file has been flagged for IDOR. This could potentially allow attackers to bypass authorization and access resources directly.\n\n4. **Insecure Cryptographic Storage**: The `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go` file has been flagged for insecure cryptographic storage. This could potentially allow attackers to decrypt sensitive data.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Given that 100% of the project files have been identified with high-severity issues, this indicates a high risk to the overall health of the project source. \n\nIn conclusion, while the project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, the identified high-severity issues pose a significant risk to the project's overall health and potential customer impact. It is recommended to address these issues promptly to mitigate potential risks.",

It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, the file `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go` has been identified with high-severity issues related to CPU and Memory usage. This could potentially impact the performance of the software, especially when handling large data.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis:** The identified issues in `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go` are of high severity, indicating a significant risk to the project. The encryption operation in this file can be CPU-intensive, especially for large data. This could lead to performance degradation and increased resource consumption, which could impact the overall health of the project.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact:** If the issues are not addressed, customers using this library could experience slow performance and increased resource usage, especially when dealing with large data. This could negatively impact the user experience and potentially lead to customer dissatisfaction.\n\n4. **Overall Issues:** The project consists of a single file, `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go`, which has been identified with high-severity issues. This indicates that 100% of the project files have issues, which is a significant concern. The issues are related to CPU and Memory usage, which are critical for the performance of the software.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment:** Given that all the project files have high-severity issues, the overall health of the project source is at risk. Immediate attention and remediation are required to address these issues and ensure the software performs optimally.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- The file `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go` has high-severity issues related to CPU and Memory usage, which could impact the performance of the software.\n- The identified issues indicate a significant risk to the project, potentially leading to performance degradation and increased resource consumption.\n- Customers using this library could experience slow performance and increased resource usage, which could negatively impact the user experience.\n- Given that all the project files have high-severity issues, the overall health of the project source is at risk.",

The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. \n\nHowever, the analysis of the project's source code has revealed several high-severity issues related to data compliance, particularly in the file `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go`. These issues could potentially impact the overall architecture of the project, as they may require significant changes to the way data is handled and stored.\n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issues could have a significant impact on customers, particularly those in industries with strict data compliance requirements such as healthcare or finance. Non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS could result in fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe project's source code contains a number of issues related to data encryption, data privacy, data retention, and compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. These issues are concentrated in the file `data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go`.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall health of the project source is at risk due to the high-severity issues identified. The fact that these issues are concentrated in a single file suggests that the project's data handling and storage mechanisms may need to be reviewed and potentially redesigned.\n\n### Highlights\n\n1. **Data Encryption Issues**: The project's source code uses base64 encoding, which is not a secure way of encoding sensitive data. This could potentially lead to a breach of GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance. \n\n2. **Data Privacy Concerns**: The 'nextToken' struct could potentially contain sensitive data in the 'Filter' or 'LastEvaluatedKey' fields. These fields are used to filter and paginate data, and could contain sensitive information such as user identifiers, email addresses, or other personal data.\n\n3. **Data Retention Problems**: The 'Expiration' field in the 'nextToken' struct could potentially lead to data being retained longer than necessary, which could violate GDPR's data minimization principle.\n\n4. **Compliance Risks**: The identified issues could result in non-compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, potentially leading to fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.\n\n5. **Risk Concentration**: The fact that all of the identified issues are concentrated in a single file (`data/dynamodb/nexttoken.go`) suggests that the project's data handling and storage mechanisms may need to be reviewed and potentially redesigned.",
