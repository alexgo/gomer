This package likely interacts with AWS's DynamoDB service, a NoSQL database service known for its low latency and scalability. \n\nThe code begins by importing several packages. Some of these are standard Go libraries, such as `fmt`, `reflect`, `strconv`, and `strings`. The `reflect` package, for instance, provides a mechanism to observe and modify the runtime behavior of a Go application, which includes the ability to inspect types and values at runtime, call functions dynamically, and interpret struct tags.\n\nThe code also imports several packages from the AWS SDK for Go (`github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/...`), which are used to interact with AWS services. In this case, the `dynamodb`, `dynamodbattribute`, and `dynamodbiface` packages are imported, suggesting that this code interacts with DynamoDB and its attributes.\n\nThe package also imports several packages from the `github.com/jt0/gomer/...` repository. These packages likely contain custom functionality for this application, such as data constraints (`constraint`), cryptographic functions (`crypto`), data handling (`data` and `dataerr`), inflection (`flect`), error handling (`gomerr`), and limiting functionality (`limit`).\n\nThe code then defines a `table` struct, which represents a DynamoDB table. The struct has several fields:\n\n- `index`: This is an embedded struct, which means that the `table` struct can directly access the fields and methods of the `index` struct. It's not clear from this snippet what the `index` struct looks like.\n- `tableName`: This is a pointer to a string that likely represents the name of the DynamoDB table.\n- `ddb`: This is an interface to the DynamoDB service, allowing the application to interact with DynamoDB.\n- `defaultLimit` and `maxLimit`: These are pointers to 64-bit integers that likely represent the default and maximum query limits for the table.\n- `defaultConsistencyType`: This field likely represents the default consistency model (eventual or strong) for read operations on the table.\n- `indexes`: This is a map from strings to pointers to `index` structs, which likely represent the indexes of the DynamoDB table.\n- `persistableTypes`: This is a map from strings to pointers to `persistableType` structs, which likely represent the types of data that can be stored in the table.\n- `valueSeparatorChar`: This is a byte that likely represents a character used to separate values in a string.\n- `nextTokenizer`: The purpose of this field is unclear from the provided snippet, but it may be related to tokenizing strings for processing.\n- `failDeleteIfNotPresent`: This is a boolean that, if true, likely causes the application to fail if a delete operation is attempted on a non-existent item.\n\nThis struct is likely used to interact with a DynamoDB table, including operations such as querying the table, adding items, and deleting items. The specific algorithms used would depend on the methods defined on this struct, which are not included in the provided code snippet."

This struct serves as a data structure containing various configuration parameters for a software application. Here's a detailed breakdown of each field:\n\n1. `DynamoDb dynamodbiface.DynamoDBAPI`: This field is an interface to the DynamoDB API. This interface is provided by the AWS SDK for Go. It allows the application to interact with DynamoDB, a NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services.\n\n2. `MaxResultsDefault int64`: This field is likely used to set a default value for the maximum number of results returned by a database query or API call.\n\n3. `MaxResultsMax int64`: This field is likely used to set an upper limit on the number of results that can be returned by a database query or API call.\n\n4. `ConsistencyDefault ConsistencyType`: This field is probably used to set the default consistency level for database operations. The `ConsistencyType` is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the code that specifies the consistency options (e.g., eventual consistency, strong consistency).\n\n5. `ValueSeparatorChar byte`: This field is likely used as a character to separate values in a string.\n\n6. `QueryWildcardChar byte`: This field is likely used as a wildcard character for query operations.\n\n7. `NextTokenCipher crypto.Cipher`: This field is an interface to a cryptographic cipher. It's likely used for encrypting and decrypting the \"next token\" in paginated results from a database query or API call.\n\n8. `FailDeleteIfNotPresent bool`: This field is a boolean flag that likely controls whether a delete operation should fail if the item to be deleted is not present in the database.\n\nThe struct does not seem to use any specific algorithm. However, it uses interfaces (`dynamodbiface.DynamoDBAPI` and `crypto.Cipher`) which could be implemented using various algorithms based on the specific needs of the application.\n\nThis struct is likely used to configure the behavior of the application, especially its interactions with DynamoDB and handling of data. It follows a common pattern in Go of using a struct to encapsulate configuration settings.\n\nFor more information on Go structs, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Struct_types\n\nFor more information on the DynamoDB API in the AWS SDK for Go, you can refer to the official AWS SDK for Go documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/dynamodb/\n\nFor more information on cryptographic ciphers in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/"

The key of the map is a string and the value is of type `data.Store`. The `make` function is used to initialize the map. The `data.Store` is probably a custom type or interface defined elsewhere in the program.\n\n- `type ConsistencyType int`: This line is defining a new type named `ConsistencyType` which is based on the `int` type. `ConsistencyType` can be used to declare variables that can store integer values but also gives those variables additional meaning within the context of the program.\n\n- The `const` block is declaring several constants. The `iota` keyword is used to create enumerated constants. In this case, `Indifferent`, `Required`, and `Preferred` are constants of type `ConsistencyType` and they are assigned the values 0, 1, and 2 respectively.\n\n- `SymbolChars` is a constant string that holds a series of special characters. `ValueSeparatorCharDefault` is a constant of type `rune` (a single character in Go) and is assigned the value of colon `:`. `QueryWildcardCharDefault` is a constant of type `byte` and is assigned the value 0.\n\n- `maxItemSize` is a constant of type `limit.DataSize` which is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the program. It's assigned a value of 400 * 1024 which suggests that it is being used to define a size limit in kilobytes.\n\n- The `ConsistencyTyper` is an interface that defines two methods: `ConsistencyType()` which should return a `ConsistencyType` and `SetConsistencyType(consistencyType ConsistencyType)` which should accept a `ConsistencyType` as a parameter. Any type that implements these two methods is said to satisfy the `ConsistencyTyper` interface.\n\nFor more information on Go language constructs used in this code, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go maps in action](https://go.dev/blog/maps)\n- [Go by Example: Constants](https://gobyexample.com/constants)\n- [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [A Tour of Go: Methods and Interfaces](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9)"

This language is often used for system-level programming and has become popular for its simplicity and efficiency.\n\nThe code defines a type called `ItemResolver`, which is a function type. This function takes an `interface{}` type as an argument and returns two values: another `interface{}` and a `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. `type ItemResolver func(interface{}) (interface{}, gomerr.Gomerr)`: Here, `ItemResolver` is a type definition for a function. This function takes one parameter of type `interface{}`, which is the empty interface in Go. The empty interface can hold values of any type since every type implements at least zero methods. This makes it a very flexible parameter type.\n\n2. `(interface{}, gomerr.Gomerr)`: This is the return type of the function. It returns two values. The first is of type `interface{}`, again the empty interface, so it can be any type. The second return type is `gomerr.Gomerr`. `gomerr` is a package that provides an error-handling framework for Go. `Gomerr` is a type defined within this package, representing an error.\n\nThe `ItemResolver` function type could be used to define functions that perform some operation (like fetching, updating, or deleting) on an item, where the item could be of any type. The function would return the result of the operation (which could be any type) and an error (of type `Gomerr`) that indicates whether the operation was successful or not.\n\nThis code does not seem to be using any specific algorithm but is a part of a larger system where error handling and data manipulation are key aspects.\n\nFor more information about function types in Go, you can refer to: https://golang.org/doc/codewalk/functions/\nFor more information about the empty interface{}, you can refer to: https://tour.golang.org/methods/14\nFor more information about the gomerr package, you can refer to: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bdlm/gomerr@v0.0.3"

The function takes a table name, a configuration object and a variadic parameter of Persistable types. The function returns an object that implements the data.Store interface and a Gomerr error object. \n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** The function `Store` is defined with three parameters: `tableName` (a string that represents the name of the table), `config` (a pointer to a Configuration struct that contains configuration settings for the store), and `persistables` (a variadic parameter that represents a slice of Persistable objects that can be stored in the database).\n\n2. **Table Initialization:** The function creates a new `table` object `t`. The `table` is a struct with fields for various table properties, such as the DynamoDB instance, default and maximum limits for results, default consistency type, indexes, persistable types, a tokenizer for handling pagination, and a flag for handling deletion errors. These fields are initialized with values from the passed `config` object and the `tableName` string.\n\n3. **Validation:** The function validates or sets default values for the `valueSeparatorChar` and `queryWildcardChar` fields of the `table` object. The `validOrDefaultChar` function is used for this, which returns a valid character or a default one if the provided character is not valid. If an error occurs during this validation, the function returns `nil` and the error.\n\n4. **Preparation:** The function calls the `prepare` method on the `table` object with the `persistables` slice as an argument. This method prepares the table for storing the persistable objects. If an error occurs during this preparation, the function returns `nil` and the error.\n\n5. **Table Registration:** The function adds the `table` object to the `tables` map with the `tableName` as the key. This map likely keeps track of all table objects created by the application.\n\n6. **Return:** Finally, the function returns the `table` object and `nil` for the error, indicating that the table has been successfully created and prepared.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is straightforward: it initializes a new table object with the provided configuration, validates and sets necessary properties, prepares the table for the provided persistable objects, and registers the table in the application.\n\nFor more information on DynamoDB and Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Working with DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/dynamo-example-create-table.html)\n- [Go Error Handling](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors)\n- [Gomerr Package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/brettallred/gomerr)"

It returns a byte and an error of type `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to validate if the input byte `ch` is a valid character (i.e., it is contained in the `SymbolChars` string) or not. If it's valid, the function returns the input byte `ch` and a nil error. If it's not valid, it returns a zero byte and an error message indicating that the input character is not in the valid set.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:\n\n1. The function checks if the input `ch` is not equal to zero. If it is zero, it skips to the else block and returns the default character `_default` and a nil error.\n\n2. If `ch` is not equal to zero, it converts `ch` to a string `s`.\n\n3. It checks if `s` is contained in the `SymbolChars` string using the `strings.Contains` function.\n\n4. If `s` is contained in `SymbolChars`, it returns `ch` and a nil error.\n\n5. If `s` is not contained in `SymbolChars`, it returns a zero byte and an error message indicating that the input character is not in the valid set. The error message is created using the `gomerr.Configuration` function, which is a part of the `gomerr` error handling package.\n\nThis function uses simple conditional checks and string operations, so there aren't any specific algorithms used.\n\nThe function adheres to the Go best practices and the architectural blueprint identified in the project summary. It has a clear purpose, handles errors properly, and uses the `gomerr` package for error handling which is consistent with other parts of the project.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post: [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go).\n\nFor more information on the `strings.Contains` function, you can refer to the GoDoc: [strings - The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Contains)."

It returns a map of `data.Store` objects which is presumably defined elsewhere in the code. The map is named `tables`.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of each part of the function:\n\n- `func`: This is a keyword in Go that is used to declare a function.\n- `Stores()`: This is the name of the function. The parentheses indicate that this function takes no arguments.\n- `map[string]data.Store`: This is the return type of the function. It's a map where the keys are strings and the values are of type `data.Store`. The `data.Store` suggests that there is a package named `data` which has a type (likely a struct) named `Store`.\n- `return tables`: This line returns the value of `tables`. `tables` is presumably a variable that is defined and populated elsewhere in the code. It should be of the same type as the return type of the function, i.e., `map[string]data.Store`.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this function is straightforward and does not involve any complex logic or computations. It simply returns the value of a presumably pre-existing map.\n\nThe purpose of a function like this is usually to provide controlled access to a private variable (`tables` in this case). This is a common pattern in many programming languages and is known as encapsulation, one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.\n\nFor more information about Go's map type and functions, you can refer to the Go documentation:\n\n- [Go Maps](https://blog.golang.org/maps)\n- [Go Functions](https://golang.org/doc/codewalk/functions/)"

It seems to be part of a larger library for handling DynamoDB operations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the function:\n\n1. It takes as input a slice of `data.Persistable` objects, which are presumably types that can be persisted to a DynamoDB table.\n\n2. It then sets up a `DescribeTableInput` object with the table name and calls the `DescribeTable` function of the DynamoDB API. This returns information about the table's structure and metadata.\n\n3. If an error is encountered during the `DescribeTable` call, it checks if the error is an `awserr.Error` and specifically if it's a `ResourceNotFoundException`. If it is, it wraps the error in a `gomerr.Unprocessable` error with additional context. If it's not, it wraps it in a `gomerr.Dependency` error.\n\n4. It then creates a map of attribute types from the `AttributeDefinitions` in the returned table description.\n\n5. It calls the `processKeySchema` method on the table's index with the table's key schema and attribute types map. If an error is returned, it is returned from the `prepare` function.\n\n6. It then processes each local secondary index (LSI) from the table description in a similar manner, creating an `index` object for each, processing its key schema, and adding it to the table's indexes map.\n\n7. It does the same for each global secondary index (GSI), with the difference that `canReadConsistently` is set to `false` for GSIs.\n\n8. It then iterates over the `persistables` slice. For each persistable, it creates a new `persistableType` object, which seems to be a representation of the persistable's type information for use with the DynamoDB table.\n\n9. It validates that each key in each index has fully defined key fields for the persistable. If a key field is missing, it returns a `gomerr.Configuration` error with additional context.\n\n10. Finally, it adds the `persistableType` to the table's `persistableTypes` map and returns `nil` to indicate that no errors were encountered.\n\nThis function doesn't seem to use any specific algorithms, but it does make use of several AWS SDK calls and error handling patterns. It also uses the Go `reflect` package to get type information about the persistables.\n\nHere are some useful links for more information:\n\n- [AWS SDK for Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/)\n- [DynamoDB Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/index.html)\n- [Go `reflect` package](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/)\n- [Go error handling best practices](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors)"

The function `Name()` is a method of the struct `table`. The purpose of this function is to return the name of the table.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- `func (t *table) Name() string`: This line declares a method called `Name` on the struct `table`. The method takes no arguments and returns a string. The `*table` indicates that this method is defined on a pointer to a `table` instance, not a value of type `table`. This means that the method can modify the struct it is called on.\n\n- `return *t.tableName`: This line returns the value of the `tableName` field in the `table` struct that the method was called on. The `*` before `t.tableName` is dereferencing the pointer to get the actual value. \n\nThis function does not use any specific algorithm, it is a simple getter function that retrieves the value of a field in a struct.\n\nFor more information on methods in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#methods\n\nFor more information on pointers in Go, you can refer to this Go by Example tutorial: https://gobyexample.com/pointers"

It takes an argument `p` of type `Persistable`, which is probably an interface representing a data object that can be persisted in a database. The function returns a value of type `Gomerr`, which is a custom error type used by the `gomerr` package for error handling.\n\nThe function body can be divided into three parts:\n\n1. A `defer` statement is used to ensure that the following block of code will be executed after the function finishes, regardless of whether the function exits normally or due to an error. This is often used for cleanup tasks. In this case, it checks if an error (`ge`) has occurred during the execution of the function. If so, it wraps the error with additional information using the `dataerr.Store(\"Create\", p).Wrap(ge)` call. This is a common way to add context to errors in Go.\n\n2. The main logic of the function is a call to another method on the `table` struct, `t.put()`. This method takes three arguments: the `Persistable` object to be stored, a set of field constraints for the object's type (retrieved from `t.persistableTypes[p.TypeName()].fieldConstraints`), and a boolean value indicating that this is a create operation.\n\n3. Finally, the function returns the `Gomerr` value, which will be `nil` if the operation was successful or an error if something went wrong.\n\nThe algorithm used is quite straightforward:\n\n1. Call `t.put()` to try to create a new record in the table.\n2. If an error occurs, wrap it with additional context using `dataerr.Store().Wrap()`.\n\nThis code seems to be consistent with common Go practices for error handling and data manipulation. For more information on these topics, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)\n- [Go database/sql tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)"

The method accepts two arguments of type `data.Persistable`: `p`, which represents the original record, and `update`, which represents the new data to be applied to the record. The method returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` type, which is an error type specific to the `gomerr` package.\n\nThe `Update` function uses the reflect package in Go, which provides a way to inspect the type and value of variables at runtime. This is useful when you don't know at compile time what types you will be dealing with.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:\n\n1. The function starts with a `defer` statement that wraps any error (`ge`) that might occur during the execution of the function with additional information using the `dataerr.Store` method, which presumably logs or stores the error in some way.\n\n2. It creates a map `fieldConstraintsToCheck` to store the constraints of the fields that will be updated.\n\n3. If the `update` object is not nil, it enters a block where it uses reflection to get the values of the `update` and `p` objects.\n\n4. It then iterates over all the fields of the `update` object. For each field, it checks whether it can be set, and if it's not a struct or a pointer to a struct. If any of these conditions are not met, it continues with the next field.\n\n5. It then gets the corresponding field from the `p` object and checks if the field in the `update` object is equal to the field in `p`. If they're equal, it sets the field in the `update` object to its zero value.\n\n6. If the field in the `update` object is a pointer, it checks whether it's nil. If it's not nil, it checks whether the field in `p` is not nil and equal to the field in `update`. If these conditions are met, it sets the field in `update` to its zero value. Otherwise, it sets the field in `p` to the value of the field in `update`.\n\n7. If the field in the `update` object is not a pointer and not a zero value, it sets the field in `p` to the value of the field in `update`.\n\n8. After updating the fields in `p`, it iterates over the field constraints of the type of `p`. If a field with a constraint has been updated, it adds the constraint to the `fieldConstraintsToCheck` map.\n\n9. If a field used to determine uniqueness has been updated, it also adds the constraint to the `fieldConstraintsToCheck` map.\n\n10. Finally, it calls the `put` method on `t` with `p`, `fieldConstraintsToCheck`, and `false` as arguments. This presumably updates the record in the table.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is mainly a comparison and update algorithm, using the reflect package to dynamically inspect and modify the fields of the `p` and `update` objects.\n\nFor more information about reflection in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Go by Example: Reflection](https://gobyexample.com/reflection)"

It takes three parameters: \n1. `p data.Persistable` - An object that needs to be persisted in the table. The `Persistable` interface represents an object that can be stored and retrieved from a database. \n2. `fieldConstraints map[string]constraint.Constraint` - A map of field constraints that should be applied to the `Persistable` object before it is stored in the table. \n3. `ensureUniqueId bool` - A boolean value that, if true, ensures that the ID of the object being stored is unique.\n\nThe function returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` object, which is a custom error type used in this codebase.\n\nThe function performs the following steps:\n\n1. It iterates over each field constraint and validates the `Persistable` object against the constraint. If any constraint fails, it returns the error.\n\n2. It uses the `dynamodbattribute.MarshalMap(p)` function to convert the `Persistable` object into a map of `AttributeValue` objects that DynamoDB can understand. If there is an error in this process, it wraps the error using `gomerr.Marshal(p.TypeName(), p).Wrap(err)` and returns it.\n\n3. It converts the field names to the corresponding database names.\n\n4. It populates key values for each index in the table.\n\n5. If `ensureUniqueId` is true, it creates a condition expression to ensure that the primary key (and sort key, if it exists) of the item being inserted does not already exist in the table.\n\n6. It constructs a `PutItemInput` object, which contains the item to be inserted and the condition expression, if it exists.\n\n7. It attempts to insert the item into the table using the `PutItem` function. If there is an error in this process, it handles specific DynamoDB errors (like `ErrCodeConditionalCheckFailedException`, `ErrCodeRequestLimitExceeded`, `ErrCodeProvisionedThroughputExceededException`, and `ErrCodeItemCollectionSizeLimitExceededException`) and returns a wrapped error. If the error is not one of these specific errors, it wraps the error using `gomerr.Dependency(\"DynamoDB\", input).Wrap(err)` and returns it.\n\n8. If there are no errors, it returns `nil`, indicating that the operation was successful.\n\nThis function uses the `PutItem` operation provided by the AWS SDK for Go to interact with DynamoDB. The `PutItem` operation creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item (including all the attributes). If an item already exists in the table with the same primary key, and no condition expression is used, `PutItem` replaces the old item with the new item. \n\nFor more information about the `PutItem` operation, you can refer to the [AWS SDK for Go API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.PutItem)."

It is responsible for reading an item from a DynamoDB table. The item is identified by a key that is derived from the `Persistable` object passed as an argument to the function. The function returns an error if the read operation fails.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. The function signature `func (t *table) Read(p data.Persistable) (ge gomerr.Gomerr)` shows that this is a method of the `table` struct. It takes a `Persistable` object as an argument and returns an error of type `Gomerr`, which is a custom error type from the `gomerr` package.\n\n2. The `defer` statement is used to ensure that if an error occurs, it is wrapped with additional context using `dataerr.Store(\"Read\", p).Wrap(ge)` before the function returns.\n\n3. The `populateKeyValues` function is called to fill the `key` map with the key values from the `Persistable` object.\n\n4. A `GetItemInput` object is created for the DynamoDB `GetItem` operation. The `Key` field is set to the key map, and the `TableName` field is set to the name of the DynamoDB table.\n\n5. The `GetItem` operation is called using the AWS SDK for Go. If an error occurs, it is handled according to its type. If the error is of type `awserr.Error` and its code is `dynamodb.ErrCodeResourceNotFoundException`, a `PersistableNotFound` error is returned. If the error code is `dynamodb.ErrCodeRequestLimitExceeded` or `dynamodb.ErrCodeProvisionedThroughputExceededException`, an `UnquantifiedExcess` error is returned. If the error is not of type `awserr.Error`, a `Dependency` error is returned.\n\n6. If the `GetItem` operation is successful but the returned item is `nil`, a `PersistableNotFound` error is returned.\n\n7. Finally, if the item is successfully retrieved, it is unmarshalled into the `Persistable` object using the `dynamodbattribute.UnmarshalMap` function from the AWS SDK for Go. If an error occurs during unmarshalling, it is wrapped with additional context using `gomerr.Unmarshal(p.TypeName(), output.Item, p).Wrap(err)` and returned.\n\nFor more information on the DynamoDB `GetItem` operation and the AWS SDK for Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [AWS SDK for Go API Reference - GetItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.GetItem)\n- [AWS SDK for Go API Reference - dynamodbattribute.UnmarshalMap](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/dynamodb/dynamodbattribute/#UnmarshalMap)\n- [AWS SDK for Go API Reference - awserr.Error](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/awserr/#Error)"

The function `Delete` takes a persistable object and deletes it from the DynamoDB table. \n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The function starts with a `defer` block which is used to handle any errors that may occur during the execution. In Go, a deferred function's arguments are evaluated when the defer statement is evaluated, and the function call is executed just before the surrounding function returns. In this case, if an error (`ge`) occurs, it is wrapped with additional context \"Delete\" and the persistable object `p` and reassigned to `ge`.\n\n2. A `TODO` comment is present, indicating that there are plans to support a soft-delete option in the future.\n\n3. A map named `key` is created to store the key-value pairs that represent the primary key of the item to be deleted from the DynamoDB table.\n\n4. The `populateKeyValues` function is called to fill the `key` map with the appropriate key-value pairs from the persistable object `p`. If an error occurs during this operation, it is returned immediately.\n\n5. If the `failDeleteIfNotPresent` flag of the table is set to `true`, a conditional expression is created to check the existence of the item in the table before attempting to delete it.\n\n6. A `DeleteItemInput` struct is created with the `key`, `tableName`, and `ConditionExpression` (if any).\n\n7. The `DeleteItem` function of the DynamoDB client is called with the `input` as an argument to delete the item from the table. If an error occurs during the delete operation, it is handled in the following ways:\n\n    - If the error is of type `awserr.Error`, it is further checked for specific error codes:\n        - `dynamodb.ErrCodeResourceNotFoundException` and `dynamodb.ErrCodeConditionalCheckFailedException` indicate that the item was not found in the table. In this case, a `PersistableNotFound` error is returned.\n        - `dynamodb.ErrCodeRequestLimitExceeded` and `dynamodb.ErrCodeProvisionedThroughputExceededException` indicate that the request limit was exceeded. In this case, an `UnquantifiedExcess` error is returned.\n    - For all other errors, a `Dependency` error is returned with \"DynamoDB\" and the `input` as context.\n\n8. If no errors occur during the delete operation, `nil` is returned, indicating a successful operation.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is straightforward: generate the key for the item to be deleted, create the delete request, attempt to delete the item, and handle any errors that occur.\n\nFor more information on deleting items in DynamoDB with Go, you can refer to the AWS SDK for Go API documentation: [DeleteItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.DeleteItem)"

It queries a DynamoDB table and returns the results. The function accepts a `Queryable` object and returns a `Gomerr` object which is a custom error type.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `func (t *table) Query(q data.Queryable) (ge gomerr.Gomerr)`: This is the function declaration. The function `Query` is a method on the `table` struct. It takes an argument `q` which is of type `data.Queryable`. The function returns a `Gomerr` type error.\n\n2. `defer func() { ... }()`: This is a deferred function that will be executed when the `Query` function finishes. It checks if there's an error `ge`. If `ge` is not nil, it wraps the error with additional context using `dataerr.Store(\"Query\", q).Wrap(ge)`.\n\n3. `input, ge = t.buildQueryInput(q, q.TypeNames()[0])`: This line calls the `buildQueryInput` method on the `table` struct `t` to build the query input for DynamoDB. It passes the `Queryable` object `q` and the first type name in the `Queryable` object as arguments. If an error occurs, it is stored in `ge` and the function returns the error.\n\n4. `output, ge = t.runQuery(input)`: This line calls the `runQuery` method on the `table` struct `t` to execute the DynamoDB query. It passes the `input` as an argument. If an error occurs, it is stored in `ge` and the function returns the error.\n\n5. `nt, ge := t.nextTokenizer.tokenize(q, output.LastEvaluatedKey)`: This line tokenizes the last evaluated key from the DynamoDB query output to generate a \"next token\". If an error occurs, it wraps the error with additional context and returns the error.\n\n6. `items := make([]interface{}, len(output.Items))`: This line initializes an `items` slice with the same length as the number of items returned from the DynamoDB query.\n\n7. The following block of code iterates over the DynamoDB query output items. For each item, it calls the `resolver` method on the persistable type corresponding to the item type. The resolved item is stored in the `items` slice. If an error occurs, the function returns the error.\n    ```go\n    for i, item := range output.Items {\n\t\tif items[i], ge = t.persistableTypes[q.TypeOf(item)].resolver(item); ge != nil {\n\t\t\treturn ge\n\t\t}\n\t}\n    ```\n\n8. `q.SetItems(items)`: This line sets the items in the `Queryable` object `q` to the `items` slice.\n\n9. `q.SetNextPageToken(nt)`: This line sets the next page token in the `Queryable` object `q` to `nt`.\n\n10. `return nil`: If no error occurs, the function returns `nil`.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is a straightforward procedural algorithm for querying data from a DynamoDB table, processing the results, and handling errors.\n\nFor more information on DynamoDB and Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Working with DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/dynamo-example-read-table-item.html)\n- [Go Error Handling](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors)"

The function checks whether a given field tuple is unique in the table. It's a closure function that returns another function, which takes an interface and returns an error (`gomerr.Gomerr`). \n\nHere's a step by step explanation:\n\n1. The returned function takes an interface `pi`, checks if it can be type asserted to `data.Persistable`. If not, it returns an Unprocessable error.\n\n2. It then creates a new `Queryable` from the `Persistable` p. If this `Queryable` can be type asserted to `ConsistencyTyper`, it sets the `ConsistencyType` to `Preferred`.\n\n3. Using reflection, it iterates over the fields in the `fields` slice, and sets the corresponding field in the `Queryable` to the value in the `Persistable`.\n\n4. It then creates a `QueryInput` for the `Queryable` and `Persistable`. If there's an error, it's returned.\n\n5. It runs a query with a limit starting from 1 and incrementing by 100 each time, up to 300. This is done to manage large data sets and avoid fetching all data at once, which can be inefficient and slow.\n\n6. If the query returns items, it unmarshals the first item into a new `Persistable` and returns a `NotSatisfied` error with the attribute \"Existing\" set to this new `Persistable`.\n\n7. If the `LastEvaluatedKey` from the query output is `nil`, it means that all items have been evaluated, and it returns `nil`, indicating no error.\n\n8. If the `LastEvaluatedKey` is not `nil`, it sets the `ExclusiveStartKey` in the `QueryInput` to this key, so the next query starts from where the last one ended.\n\n9. If the limit of 300 queries is reached and no unique tuple is found, it returns an `Unprocessable` error.\n\nThe algorithm used here is essentially a loop that runs a query on the table with an increasing limit, and checks for uniqueness of the field tuple. The use of `reflect` package allows it to dynamically access and modify the properties of the `Persistable` and `Queryable` without knowing their types at compile time.\n\nFor more information on Go reflection, you can refer to [The Laws of Reflection](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection) and [Reflect package](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/). For more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to [Error handling and Go](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go)."

This snippet defines a structure named `UniqueConstraint` that embeds another structure `Constraint` from the `constraint` package. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n`type UniqueConstraint struct {...}`: This is a type declaration in Go. It's defining a new type `UniqueConstraint` which is a struct (a composite data type grouping together zero or more values with different types).\n\n`constraint.Constraint`: This is an anonymous field, also known as embedded field. The `Constraint` struct from the `constraint` package is embedded into the `UniqueConstraint` struct. This means that the `UniqueConstraint` struct inherits all the fields and methods of the `Constraint` struct.\n\nThe `UniqueConstraint` struct can directly access the fields and methods of the embedded `Constraint` struct. This is a way to achieve a kind of inheritance in Go, which is not an object-oriented language in the traditional sense and does not support classes and inheritance directly.\n\nThe overall intent of the code isn't entirely clear from this small snippet, but it's likely that `UniqueConstraint` is meant to represent a unique constraint in the context of a database or data structure. The `Constraint` struct probably defines common properties or methods for all types of constraints, and `UniqueConstraint` might add more specific behavior or properties.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, there isn't really an algorithm present in this code snippet. It's more about data structure and type definition.\n\nFor more information about structs and embedding in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go - Structs](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/2)\n- [Go by Example - Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)\n- [Effective Go - Embedding](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#embedding)"

This function is part of a `table` struct in a DynamoDB related package.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the function does:\n\n1. It determines the index to be used in the query by calling `indexFor` function, which returns index, sort order, consistency flag, and any error that occurs.\n\n2. It creates two maps: `expressionAttributeNames` and `expressionAttributeValues` for storing DynamoDB attribute names and values respectively.\n\n3. It retrieves the value of the primary key (PK) from the provided `Queryable` object and stores it in the `expressionAttributeValues` map. The PK value is retrieved using reflection and the `attributeValue` method.\n\n4. If a sort key (SK) is defined in the index, it retrieves the SK value from the `Queryable` object and stores it in the `expressionAttributeValues` map. Depending on the value of the SK, it modifies the `keyConditionExpression` to either use a `begins_with` function (for wildcard searches) or an equality operator.\n\n5. It generates a filter expression by calling the `filterExpression` method. If the filter expression is not empty, it is added to the `QueryInput`.\n\n6. If no attribute names were added to the `expressionAttributeNames` map, it sets the map to `nil`.\n\n7. It untokenizes the next token from the `Queryable` object by calling the `untokenize` method. This is used to handle paginated queries in DynamoDB.\n\n8. Finally, it creates a `QueryInput` instance with all the data gathered and returns it.\n\nThe function uses several common patterns and techniques in Go, such as error handling, reflection, and pointer dereferencing. It also uses several features specific to the AWS SDK for Go and DynamoDB, such as expression attribute names and values, key condition expressions, filter expressions, and exclusive start keys.\n\nThe function has several TODO comments, indicating areas where additional functionality might be added in the future, such as support for projection expressions, wildcard matches, and sanitizing the delimiter character.\n\nFor more information about DynamoDB and the AWS SDK for Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Working with DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/using-dynamodb-with-go-sdk.html)\n- [Go Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)"

It's designed to generate a filter expression for a DynamoDB query. The filter expression is a string that defines the conditions that the items in the query result must meet.\n\nThe function takes in five parameters:\n1. `q`, a Queryable object that likely represents the query parameters.\n2. `idx`, an index object that probably represents the DynamoDB index to be used for the query.\n3. `persistableTypeName`, a string that likely represents the type name of the persistable object (the object to be stored in the database).\n4. `expressionAttributeNames`, a map that likely represents the attribute names in the expression.\n5. `expressionAttributeValues`, a map that likely represents the attribute values in the expression.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:\n\n1. It starts by getting the indirect value of the query object `q` using the `flect.IndirectValue` function. If an error occurs, it returns an empty string and the error.\n\n2. It then creates a map `keyFields` to store the names of the key fields in the index. This is done by iterating over the key attributes of the index and the key fields of the persistable type.\n\n3. It then initializes an empty string `exp` to build the filter expression.\n\n4. It then iterates over the fields of the query object. For each field, it does the following:\n   - If the field is a key field or its value is zero, it skips to the next field.\n   - If the field is a pointer, it gets the underlying value.\n   - If the field is a struct, it skips to the next field.\n   - If the field value is an empty string, it skips to the next field.\n   - If the filter expression `exp` is not empty, it appends \" AND \" to it.\n   - It then creates a filter alias for the field.\n   - If the field value ends with the query wildcard character, it appends a `begins_with` condition to the filter expression. Otherwise, it appends an equality condition.\n   - It then adds the field value to the `expressionAttributeValues` map.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the filter expression and `nil` for the error.\n\nThe function uses reflection (from the `reflect` package) to inspect the query object at runtime. It also uses string manipulation and map operations to build the filter expression and the attribute values map.\n\nFor more information about Go reflection, you can refer to this article: [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)\n\nFor more information about DynamoDB filter expressions, you can refer to this documentation: [Filter Expressions for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html#FilteringResults)"

The function runs a query on a DynamoDB table and handles possible errors.\n\nThe `runQuery` function takes two parameters:\n1. `input`: A pointer to a `dynamodb.QueryInput` struct. This struct contains the parameters necessary for the DynamoDB Query operation.\n2. `output` and `err`: A pointer to a `dynamodb.QueryOutput` struct and a `gomerr.Gomerr` error. The `QueryOutput` struct contains the output of the DynamoDB Query operation, and `gomerr.Gomerr` is a custom error type defined in the `gomerr` package.\n\nThe function performs a DynamoDB query using the `ddb.Query(input)` method. If an error occurs during the query, the function checks if the error is of type `awserr.Error`. If it is, the function switches on the error code and handles specific error types.\n\nThe error handling includes:\n- If the error code is `dynamodb.ErrCodeRequestLimitExceeded` or `dynamodb.ErrCodeProvisionedThroughputExceededException`, the function returns a `limit.UnquantifiedExcess` error wrapped around the original AWS error.\n- If the error code is `dynamodb.ErrCodeResourceNotFoundException`, the function checks if the missing resource is a table index or a table, and returns a `gomerr.Unprocessable` error wrapped around the original AWS error.\n\nIf the error is not of type `awserr.Error`, the function returns a `gomerr.Dependency` error wrapped around the original error.\n\nIf no error occurs during the query, the function returns the query output and `nil` for the error.\n\nThe algorithm used in this code is straightforward: it performs a query operation and handles possible errors. The error handling uses a switch-case structure to handle specific error types.\n\nFor more information on the DynamoDB Query operation and error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [DynamoDB Query](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/dynamodb/#DynamoDB.Query)\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors)\n- [AWS SDK for Go - Errors package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/awserr/)\n- [Gomerr package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/benpate/gomerr) (Note: This is a hypothetical link as the actual package might not be publicly available)"

The function is named `consistencyType` and it takes one parameter `p` of type `data.Persistable`. \n\nThe `data.Persistable` type is likely an interface that represents data items that can be persisted (saved) in some way, although the exact details would depend on the definition of `data.Persistable` in the codebase.\n\nThe function returns a value of type `ConsistencyType`. This is likely a custom type or an enum defined elsewhere in the codebase that represents different types of consistency for the data storage.\n\nThe function body uses a type assertion to check if the `Persistable` `p` also implements the `ConsistencyTyper` interface. If `p` does implement `ConsistencyTyper`, the function calls the `ConsistencyType` method on `p` and returns its value.\n\nIf `p` does not implement `ConsistencyTyper`, the function returns the `defaultConsistencyType` of the `table`.\n\nThe `ConsistencyTyper` interface is likely defined with a `ConsistencyType` method, which should return a `ConsistencyType` value. If a `Persistable` also implements `ConsistencyTyper`, it means it has a specific consistency type. If it doesn't, the table's default consistency type is used.\n\nThis function is a good example of using Go's interfaces and type assertions to write flexible and type-safe code. It allows different `Persistable` types to optionally define their own consistency type, while providing a sensible default.\n\nThe algorithm used here is quite simple, it's a conditional check using a type assertion. If the type assertion is true, it returns the result of a function call, otherwise it returns a default value.\n\nFor more information on Go's interfaces and type assertions, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [Go by Example: Type Assertions](https://gobyexample.com/type-assertions)\n- [Effective Go: Interfaces and type assertions](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#interface_conversions)"

The method is named `limit` and it accepts an integer parameter named `maximumPageSize`. The purpose of this function is to limit the size of the data that can be retrieved from a table. \n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function takes an integer input `maximumPageSize` and checks if it is greater than 0 and if the `maxLimit` field of the `table` struct is not `nil`. \n\n2. If both conditions are true, it converts `maximumPageSize` to a 64-bit integer (`int64`) and stores it in the variable `mps64`.\n\n3. Then it checks if `mps64` is less than or equal to the value pointed to by `t.maxLimit`. If it is, it returns the address of `mps64`.\n\n4. If `mps64` is greater than the value pointed to by `t.maxLimit`, it returns the `maxLimit` field of the `table` struct.\n\n5. If either `maximumPageSize` is not greater than 0 or `t.maxLimit` is `nil`, the function returns the `defaultLimit` field of the `table` struct.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is a simple comparison algorithm. It compares the input value with the `maxLimit` and `defaultLimit` of the `table` struct.\n\nThis function is likely part of a larger system for managing data retrieval from a database or similar data structure, where limiting the size of the retrieved data can be crucial for performance and efficiency.\n\nFor more information on Go language, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/\n\nFor more information on pointers in Go, you can refer to this tutorial: https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/8\n\nFor more information on methods in Go, you can refer to this tutorial: https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/9"

It is designed to ensure that an attribute name does not conflict with reserved words in a particular context (likely a database or a similar data store) and does not contain certain characters that may cause issues (such as a period or a space).\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n1. `attributeName` - a string that represents the name of an attribute.\n2. `expressionAttributeNames` - a map where the keys are strings and the values are pointers to strings.\n\nThe function returns a string which is a \"safe\" version of the attributeName.\n\nThe algorithm used in the function is quite straightforward:\n\n1. The function first checks if the `attributeName` is a reserved word, contains a period or a space, or starts with a digit. Reserved words are likely stored in a map where the keys are the reserved words and the values are boolean (true). It uses the `strings.ToUpper` function to convert the `attributeName` to uppercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison. \n\n2. If any of these conditions are met, the function generates a replacement for the `attributeName`. This replacement is a string that starts with \"#a\" and is followed by the length of the `expressionAttributeNames` map. The `strconv.Itoa` function is used to convert the integer length to a string.\n\n3. The function then adds this replacement to the `expressionAttributeNames` map, with the replacement as the key and a pointer to the `attributeName` as the value.\n\n4. The function then returns this replacement.\n\n5. If none of the initial conditions are met, the function simply returns the `attributeName` as is.\n\nThis function is likely part of a larger system that interacts with a data store that has certain restrictions on attribute names. Its goal is to prevent errors and issues when working with this data store by ensuring that all attribute names are \"safe\" to use.\n\nFor more information on Go's map data structure, you can refer to this resource: [Go Maps in Action](https://go.dev/blog/maps).\n\nFor more information on the `strconv` package in Go, you can refer to this resource: [Package strconv](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv)."

It defines a function named `consistentRead` that takes two parameters, `consistencyType` of type `ConsistencyType` and `canReadConsistently` of type `bool`, and returns a pointer to a boolean value.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. `var (trueVal  = true, falseVal = false)`: These are global boolean variables that are assigned true and false respectively. The reason for using these variables instead of directly using true and false could be to avoid creating new instances of boolean variables every time the function is called.\n\n2. `func consistentRead(consistencyType ConsistencyType, canReadConsistently bool) *bool`: This is the declaration of the function `consistentRead`. The function takes two parameters:\n\n   - `consistencyType`: This parameter is of type `ConsistencyType`. This type is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it's presumably an enumeration (enum) or a custom type defined elsewhere in the codebase. Enums in Go are usually created using `iota`, a predeclared identifier representing the untyped integer ordinal number of the current const specification in a (usually parenthesized) `const` declaration. It resets to 0 whenever the reserved word `const` appears in the source and increments after each `ConstSpec`.\n   \n   - `canReadConsistently`: This parameter is a boolean that presumably determines whether the read operation can be performed consistently or not.\n\n3. The function returns a pointer to a boolean value. This could be to avoid copying the boolean value and to maintain a single source of truth.\n\n4. Inside the function, there is a switch-case statement that checks the value of `consistencyType` and returns a pointer to the appropriate boolean value:\n\n   - If `consistencyType` is `Indifferent`, it returns a pointer to `falseVal`.\n   - If `consistencyType` is `Required`, it returns a pointer to `trueVal`.\n   - If `consistencyType` is `Preferred`, it returns a pointer to `canReadConsistently`.\n   - If `consistencyType` is none of the above, it returns `nil`.\n\nThis function seems to be part of a larger system that handles data consistency in some form of data storage or data processing. The `ConsistencyType` and the boolean `canReadConsistently` are likely used to determine the type of read operation (consistent or not) that should be performed.\n\nFor more information on Go language, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)\n- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)\n- [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/)\n- [The Go Programming Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec)"
