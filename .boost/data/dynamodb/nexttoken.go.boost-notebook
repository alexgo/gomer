It is a part of a package named `dynamodb` which likely interacts with Amazon's DynamoDB service, a NoSQL database service.\n\nThe code imports several packages:\n\n- `encoding/base64` and `encoding/json` are standard Go packages for handling base64 and JSON encoding respectively.\n- `fmt` and `strings` are also standard Go packages for formatting strings and handling string operations.\n- `time` is used for time-related operations.\n- `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws` and `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/dynamodb` are AWS SDK packages for Go, used for interacting with AWS services, specifically DynamoDB.\n- `github.com/jt0/gomer/crypto` is likely a custom package for cryptographic operations.\n- `github.com/jt0/gomer/data` is likely a custom package for handling data in some specific way.\n- `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr` is likely a custom package for error handling.\n\nThe code then defines a new type `nextTokenizer` which has a `cipher` field of type `crypto.Cipher`. This suggests that `nextTokenizer` will be used for some sort of cryptographic operations, likely related to tokenization. Tokenization is a process of replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive data, called tokens, which have no exploitable meaning. This is often used in the context of data security.\n\nThe `crypto.Cipher` type is not defined in this code snippet, but it likely represents a cipher for cryptographic operations, based on its name and the fact that it's part of the `crypto` package. A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption.\n\nAs for the algorithms used, it's hard to say without seeing more of the code. The imported packages suggest that it might involve base64 encoding, JSON encoding, and some sort of cryptographic operations, but the specifics would depend on how these packages are used in the rest of the code.\n\nFor more information on the topics related to this code, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: JSON](https://gobyexample.com/json)\n- [Go by Example: Base64 Encoding](https://gobyexample.com/base64-encoding)\n- [AWS SDK for Go API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/)\n- [Go documentation on packages](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Packages)\n- [Tokenization (data security) on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security))\n- [Cipher on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher)"

It is similar to classes in OOP languages.\n\nThe `nextToken` struct has four fields:\n\n1. `Version`: This is an unsigned integer (`uint`) that likely represents the version of the next token. \n\n2. `Filter`: This is a map with string keys and pointers to string values. This could be used to filter out certain results when the next token is used.\n\n3. `LastEvaluatedKey`: This is a map with string keys and string values. In the context of DynamoDB, LastEvaluatedKey is used for pagination. DynamoDB returns a set of results (a page) that fit within the 1 MB size limit. If there are more results, it also returns the LastEvaluatedKey value. You can use this value in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.\n\n4. `Expiration`: This is a `time.Time` value that likely represents when the next token will expire.\n\nEach field is annotated with a `json` struct tag. These tags define how the struct fields are encoded to or decoded from JSON. For example, the `Version` field is encoded to JSON as `v`.\n\nThe struct doesn't seem to use any specific algorithms. It is a simple data structure used to hold related pieces of data.\n\nFor more information on Go structs, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go - Structs](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/2)\n- [Go by Example: Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)\n\nFor more information on DynamoDB pagination and the LastEvaluatedKey, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [DynamoDB Developer Guide - Query Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.Pagination.html)\n- [AWS SDK for Go API Reference - LastEvaluatedKey](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/dynamodb#QueryOutput.LastEvaluatedKey)\n\nThe code appears to be consistent with the architectural guidelines provided. It is a simple struct definition and doesn't seem to violate any architectural principles or constraints."

The method does not take any parameters and returns a value of type `time.Time`.\n\n- `return nt.Expiration`: This line returns the `Expiration` field of the `nextToken` instance.

Getter methods are common in object-oriented programming and are used to retrieve the value of an object's attribute.\n\nThere isn't any specific algorithm used in this function as it's a simple getter function. The function is likely part of a larger codebase where `nextToken` objects are used, possibly for managing tokens in an authentication system. The `ExpiresAt` method would be used to determine when a token expires.\n\nFor more information about methods in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#methods\n\nFor more information about the `time.Time` type in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time\n\nAs far as architectural guidelines are concerned, this function seems to follow standard Go practices. It's a simple, single-responsibility function that follows the naming conventions of Go (CamelCase for exported functions). There doesn't seem to be any conflict with typical software architecture principles."

It's a simple piece of code that declares a few constants and a variable.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. `const`: This keyword is used to declare constants in Go. Constants are similar to variables, but their values cannot be changed once they are declared. In this code, we have three constants declared: `stringPrefix`, `numberPrefix`, and `NextPageToken`.\n\n   - `stringPrefix` is assigned the value `\"S:\"`\n   - `numberPrefix` is assigned the value `\"N:\"`\n   - `NextPageToken` is assigned the value `\"NextPageToken\"`\n\n2. `var`: This keyword is used to declare variables in Go. In this code, we have one variable declared: `formatVersionExpirations`.\n\n   - `formatVersionExpirations` is declared as a slice of `time.Time` values. A slice is a data structure in Go that holds items of a specific type. The `time.Time` type represents a point in time with nanosecond precision. The slice is initialized with one value: `time.Date(1971, 11, 30, 3, 56, 0, 0, time.UTC)`. This represents the date and time when version \"0\" expired.\n\nThe purpose of this code snippet is not entirely clear without additional context. However, it appears to be setting up some constants and a variable related to some kind of versioning or pagination system. The prefixes might be used for some kind of string encoding or identification system, and the `NextPageToken` constant might be used for pagination in an API or similar system.\n\nThe `formatVersionExpirations` variable could be used to track the expiration times of different versions of something, perhaps a data format or API version. The only version expiration time provided is for \"version 0\", which expired at the specified date and time.\n\nThis code does not appear to use any specific algorithms, but it does use some basic features of the Go language, such as constants, variables, slices, and the `time.Time` type.\n\nFor more information on these features of Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Constants](https://gobyexample.com/constants)\n- [Go by Example: Variables](https://gobyexample.com/variables)\n- [Go by Example: Slices](https://gobyexample.com/slices)\n- [Go by Example: Time](https://gobyexample.com/time)"

It appears to be part of a system that interacts with a DynamoDB database, and handles the creation of a token for pagination.\n\nHere's a line-by-line explanation:\n\n1. `var formatVersion = uint(len(formatVersionExpirations))`: This line declares a global variable `formatVersion` that converts the length of `formatVersionExpirations` to an unsigned integer. `formatVersionExpirations` is not defined in the provided code, but it likely contains different versions of token formats.\n\n2. `func (t *nextTokenizer) tokenize(q data.Queryable, lastEvaluatedKey map[string]*dynamodb.AttributeValue) (*string, gomerr.Gomerr) {`: This line defines a method `tokenize` on the `nextTokenizer` type. The method takes two arguments: `q` of type `data.Queryable` and `lastEvaluatedKey` which is a map with string keys and `dynamodb.AttributeValue` values. It returns a pointer to a string and a `gomerr.Gomerr` error.\n\n3. `if lastEvaluatedKey == nil { return nil, nil }`: This line checks if `lastEvaluatedKey` is `nil`. If it is, the function returns `nil` for both the string pointer and the error.\n\n4. The next block of code creates a `nextToken` struct and assigns values to its fields. `Version` is set to `formatVersion`, `Filter` is set to `nil` (with a TODO comment indicating this should be updated), `LastEvaluatedKey` is set to the result of `encodeLastEvaluatedKey(lastEvaluatedKey)`, and `Expiration` is set to the result of `expirationTime()`.\n\n5. `toEncrypt, err := json.Marshal(nt)`: This line marshals the `nextToken` struct to a JSON format and assigns it to `toEncrypt`. If an error occurs during marshaling, it is assigned to `err`.\n\n6. `if err != nil { return nil, gomerr.Marshal(NextPageToken, nt).Wrap(err) }`: This line checks if an error occurred during marshaling. If it did, it wraps the error with additional information and returns `nil` for the string pointer and the wrapped error.\n\n7. `encrypted, ge := t.cipher.Encrypt(toEncrypt, nil)`: This line encrypts the marshaled `nextToken` using the `Encrypt` method of the `cipher` field of `nextTokenizer`. The second argument to `Encrypt` is `nil`, but a TODO comment indicates that this should be updated to provide an encryption context.\n\n8. `if ge != nil { return nil, ge }`: This line checks if an error occurred during encryption. If it did, it returns `nil` for the string pointer and the error.\n\n9. `encoded := base64.RawURLEncoding.EncodeToString(encrypted)`: This line encodes the encrypted `nextToken` to a base64 string.\n\n10. `return &encoded, nil`: This line returns a pointer to the base64-encoded string and `nil` for the error.\n\nIn summary, this function is designed to create a token for pagination in a DynamoDB query. It creates a `nextToken` struct, marshals it to JSON, encrypts it, and then encodes it to a base64 string. The function handles errors at each step and returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` error if any occur.\n\nFor more information on Go server application architecture and best practices, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Working with DynamoDB in Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/dynamo-example-read-table-item.html)\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)\n- [JSON and Go](https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Base64 Encoding](https://gobyexample.com/base64-encoding)"

This token is used for pagination in a database query, specifically for AWS DynamoDB. \n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of what the function does:\n\n1. The function first checks if the `NextPageToken` is `nil`. If it is, the function returns `nil` for both the map of `dynamodb.AttributeValue` and the error (`gomerr.Gomerr`). This means there's no token to decode, and hence, no further processing is needed.\n\n2. If the token exists, the function attempts to decode it from a Base64-encoded string using `base64.RawURLEncoding.DecodeString`. If there's an error during decoding, it returns a `MalformedValue` error from the `gomerr` package. This error indicates that the token is not properly Base64-encoded.\n\n3. If the Base64 decoding is successful, the function attempts to decrypt the token using the `cipher.Decrypt` method. If decryption fails, it returns another `MalformedValue` error, indicating that the token could not be decrypted.\n\n4. If decryption is successful, the function attempts to unmarshal the decrypted token into a `nextToken` struct using `json.Unmarshal`. If this fails, it returns another `MalformedValue` error, indicating that the token could not be unmarshalled into the `nextToken` struct.\n\n5. The function then checks the version of the token against the expected format version. If they don't match, it returns a `ValueExpired` error, indicating that the token uses an old format version.\n\n6. The function also checks if the token has expired by calling the `tokenExpired` method on the `nextToken` struct. If the token has expired, it returns a `ValueExpired` error.\n\n7. If all the checks pass, the function decodes the `LastEvaluatedKey` field of the token and returns it. This key is used by DynamoDB for pagination.\n\nThe function uses the following algorithms:\n- Base64 decoding: an algorithm for converting data into a string representation that can be transmitted and stored easily.\n- Decryption: an algorithm for converting encrypted data back into its original form.\n- JSON unmarshalling: an algorithm for converting a JSON-encoded string back into a Go data structure.\n\nFor more information on these topics, you can refer to the following resources:\n- [Base64 Encoding and Decoding](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/base64/)\n- [JSON and Go](https://blog.golang.org/json)\n- [AWS SDK for Go - DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/dynamodb/)"

This function is named `expirationTime` and it does not take any parameters. The function returns a value of type `time.Time`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the function does:\n\n1. `time.Now()` is a function provided by the Go standard library's `time` package. It returns the current local time.\n   \n2. `.UTC()` is a method that converts the local time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It's good practice to use UTC when dealing with times in a programming context to avoid issues with time zones and daylight saving time changes.\n\n3. `.Add(time.Hour * 24)` is another method that adds a duration to the time. In this case, it's adding 24 hours to the current time. `time.Hour` is a constant provided by the `time` package that represents one hour.\n\nSo, the `expirationTime` function returns the current time in UTC, plus 24 hours. This could be used, for example, to set an expiration time for a token or a cache item.\n\nRegarding the algorithm used, it's a simple time manipulation algorithm. The function is using the system's clock to get the current time, converting it to UTC, and then adding a duration to it.\n\nFor more information about the `time` package in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/time. You can also learn more about handling times in Go from this blog post: https://yourbasic.org/golang/time-date-difference-clock/. \n\nIn terms of architectural guidelines, this function is quite standard and should not conflict with most guidelines. It is a simple utility function that doesn't have any side effects or dependencies, which makes it easy to test and reuse."

It is a method of the `nextToken` struct. This function doesn't seem to use any complex algorithms; it simply compares the current time with the expiration time of the token.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n\n1. `func (nt *nextToken) tokenExpired() bool`: This is the function declaration. It is a method named `tokenExpired` that belongs to the `nextToken` type. The method doesn't take any parameters and returns a boolean value. The receiver `nt` is a pointer to a `nextToken` instance.\n\n2. `return time.Now().UTC().After(nt.Expiration)`: This is the body of the function. It checks if the current UTC time is after the expiration time of the token. \n\n    - `time.Now().UTC()`: This gets the current time in UTC format.\n   \n    - `nt.Expiration`: This is accessing the `Expiration` field of the `nextToken` struct which is presumably a `time.Time` value representing when the token expires.\n   \n    - `After(nt.Expiration)`: This is a method of the `Time` struct in the `time` package. It checks if the current time (`time.Now().UTC()`) is after the `Expiration` time of the token. If the current time is after the expiration time, it means the token has expired, so it returns `true`. If not, it returns `false`.\n\nThe function `tokenExpired` is a typical way to check token expiration in many systems dealing with authentication and authorization. The underlying principle is simple: if the current time surpasses the expiration time, the token is no longer valid.\n\nFor more information on the `time` package in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/time. This package provides functionality for measuring and displaying time."

Otherwise, it would return `false`.\n\nThis function appears to be a part of a version control or backward compatibility system. Here, each version of the format has an expiration time, and this function is used to check whether a given `nextToken` instance is using an expired format version.\n\nThis function uses a simple comparison algorithm to check version equality and a time comparison algorithm to check whether the current time is after the expiration time of a given version.\n\nFor more information on time handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/pkg/time/\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, this function seems to be well-structured, modular, and follows good practices of encapsulation by making `formatVersionExpired` a method of the `nextToken` struct. This function does not appear to conflict with any common architectural guidelines or constraints."

The `dynamodb.AttributeValue` is a struct in AWS SDK for Go that represents an attribute of a DynamoDB item.\n\nThe function then creates a new map `lek` with the same length as `lastEvaluatedKey`. The keys in `lek` are strings and the values are also strings.\n\nThe function then iterates over each entry in `lastEvaluatedKey`. For each key-value pair, it checks if the `AttributeValue` is of type string (`S`) or number (`N`). If it is a string, the function adds an entry to `lek` with the same key and the value prefixed with `stringPrefix`. If it is a number, the function adds an entry to `lek` with the same key and the value prefixed with `numberPrefix`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `lek` map.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is a simple iteration over a map, with a conditional check for each entry. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of entries in the input map.\n\nThis function is likely part of a larger system that interacts with AWS DynamoDB. The `lastEvaluatedKey` is used in DynamoDB to handle paginated results. When you request a set of items from DynamoDB, it might not return all the items in one response, especially if there are a lot of items to return. Instead, it returns a subset of items and a `lastEvaluatedKey`. You can use this key in a subsequent request to get the next set of items.\n\nFor more information on DynamoDB and the `AttributeValue` struct, you can refer to the AWS SDK for Go documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/dynamodb#AttributeValue\n\nAnd for more information on DynamoDB pagination and the use of `lastEvaluatedKey`, you can refer to the DynamoDB Developer Guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.Pagination.html"

The function `decodeLastEvaluatedKey` is declared with an argument `lek` of type `map[string]string`. This function returns a `map[string]*dynamodb.AttributeValue`.\n\n2. A new map `exclusiveStartKey` is created with the same type as the return type of the function.\n\n3. The function then starts a loop over the `lek` map. The `range` keyword is used to iterate over map type data in Go. It returns both the key and value for each entry in the map.\n\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if the value of the current map entry starts with a `numberPrefix` using the `strings.HasPrefix` function. This function returns true if the string (in this case, the value of the map entry) starts with the specified prefix.\n\n5. If the value does start with `numberPrefix`, it creates a new `dynamodb.AttributeValue` with `N` (representing a number type in DynamoDB) set to the value of the map entry, after removing the `numberPrefix` using `strings.TrimPrefix`. It then assigns this new `AttributeValue` to the `exclusiveStartKey` map at the position of the current key.\n\n6. If the value does not start with `numberPrefix`, it assumes the value starts with a `stringPrefix` and does a similar operation as in step 5, but sets `S` (representing a string type in DynamoDB) in the `AttributeValue`.\n\n7. After the loop, the function returns the `exclusiveStartKey` map.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a simple map iteration and string prefix checking. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input map `lek`.\n\nThis function is a part of Amazon DynamoDB data handling where it decodes the last evaluated key. The LastEvaluatedKey is used to continue a previous operation, for example, when you're paginating results.\n\nFor more information on DynamoDB and AttributeValue, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)\n- [AttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeValue.html)\n- [Working with Queries in DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html)"

These functions are computationally expensive as they iterate over the entire string.\n\n   **Solution**: Consider using a more efficient algorithm to perform these operations. For example, you could use a switch statement to check the first character of the string and perform the appropriate action. This would only require a single pass over the string. Also, consider precomputing the trimmed values and storing them in a lookup table if the set of possible values is small and known in advance.\n\n\n2. **Severity**: 2/10\n\n   **Line Number**: 292\n\n   **Bug Type**: Memory\n\n   **Description**: The function decodeLastEvaluatedKey creates a new map and a new dynamodb.AttributeValue for each key-value pair in the input map. This can lead to high memory usage if the input map is large.\n\n   **Solution**: Consider reusing the input map or the dynamodb.AttributeValue objects if possible. If the input map is not used elsewhere, you could modify it in place instead of creating a new map. Similarly, if the dynamodb.AttributeValue objects are not used elsewhere, you could modify them in place instead of creating new objects.\n\n\n"
