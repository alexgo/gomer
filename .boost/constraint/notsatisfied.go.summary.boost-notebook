This file handles constraint errors and includes a field 'ToTest' that is included in error messages. If this field contains sensitive data, it could lead to data exposure, violating GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA regulations. This is a significant architectural risk that needs immediate attention.\n\n2. **Percentage of Files with Issues:** With only one file in the project, the percentage of files with issues is 100%. This indicates a high risk level for the project, as every part of the codebase has potential issues.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact:** The data privacy and exposure issues could have a significant impact on customers. If sensitive data is exposed, it could lead to a loss of trust, potential legal issues, and a negative impact on the company's reputation.\n\n4. **Overall Health of the Project Source:** The overall health of the project source is concerning. With only one file in the project and that file having issues, it indicates that there may be systemic issues with the codebase that need to be addressed.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Data Sanitization:** Implement a method to sanitize or mask sensitive data before it is included in error messages. This could be done by creating a custom error type that includes a sanitized version of the data.\n\n2. **Code Review and Refactoring:** Conduct a thorough code review and refactoring process to address the issues identified in the `constraint/notsatisfied.go` file.\n\n3. **Implement Security Best Practices:** Ensure that the project follows security best practices to prevent data exposure and privacy issues.\n\n4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement a system for continuous monitoring and auditing of the codebase to identify and address issues as they arise.\n\nIn conclusion, while the project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, there are significant data privacy and exposure issues that need to be addressed. The overall health of the project source is concerning, and a thorough review and refactoring process is recommended.",
