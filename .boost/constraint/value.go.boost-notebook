This package is likely used for validation or constraint checking in the rest of the application.\n\nThe code imports three packages:\n- `reflect`: This is a built-in Go package that allows the program to inspect the type and structure of variables at runtime.\n- `github.com/jt0/gomer/flect`: This is an external package, likely providing some utilities for reflection.\n- `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr`: This is another external package, likely used for custom error handling in the application.\n\nThe code then defines two variables `IsNil` and `IsNotNil` which are instances of a `nilConstraint` function. This function returns a `Constraint` object, which is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe `nilConstraint` function takes two parameters: a string `name` and a boolean `errorIfNil`. It returns a new `Constraint` object, which is created using the `New` function (not shown in the provided code snippet). The `New` function takes three parameters: the `name`, `nil`, and a function which defines the behavior of the constraint.\n\nThis function uses the `reflect` package to inspect the type of the variable to test. If the variable is of a type that can be `nil` (pointer, interface, map, slice, channel, or function), it checks if the variable is `nil`. If the variable is `nil` and `errorIfNil` is `true`, or if the variable is not `nil` and `errorIfNil` is `false`, it returns a `NotSatisfied` error. If not, it returns `nil`, indicating no error.\n\nIf the variable is not of a type that can be `nil`, it returns an `Unprocessable` error from the `gomerr` package.\n\nIn summary, this code defines two constraints `IsNil` and `IsNotNil` that can be used to check if a variable is `nil` or not, and return custom errors if the constraint is not satisfied. The checking is done at runtime using reflection, which allows the program to handle variables of any type.\n\nFor more information on reflection in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Go by Example: Reflection](https://gobyexample.com/reflection)"

The `Nil` function is used to create a new constraint that checks if a value is nil.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. `func Nil(value *interface{}) Constraint:` This line declares the `Nil` function that takes a pointer to an interface (`value`) as input and returns a `Constraint`. An interface in Go is a type that defines a set of methods. Here `value` is a pointer to any type that implements the empty interface (i.e., any type at all).\n\n2. `return New(\"Nil\", value, func(interface{}) gomerr.Gomerr {`: This line calls a function named `New` and returns its result. The `New` function seems to be a constructor for a `Constraint` object. It takes three arguments: a string (\"Nil\"), the `value` to be checked, and an anonymous function. The anonymous function takes an interface as an argument and returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` type, which is likely a custom error type used in this codebase.\n\n3. `return IsNil.Test(value)`: This line is the body of the anonymous function. It calls the `Test` method on `IsNil` with `value` as the argument and returns the result. The `IsNil` object and its `Test` method are not defined in the provided code, but it can be inferred that `IsNil.Test(value)` checks if `value` is nil and returns an error if it is not.\n\nThe algorithm used here is simple: the function creates a new `Constraint` that checks if a value is nil. This is a common pattern in Go, where functions are used to create and configure objects. The use of interfaces and function types allows for a high degree of flexibility and reusability.\n\nFor more information on Go functions, interfaces, and error handling, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go: Functions](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/6)\n- [A Tour of Go: Interfaces](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)"

The function `NotNil` takes a pointer to an interface as an argument and returns a `Constraint`. A `Constraint` is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the codebase that encapsulates a rule or condition that a value must meet.\n\nThe function `NotNil` uses a function `New` to create a new `Constraint`. The `New` function likely takes a name for the constraint, a value to apply the constraint to, and a function that tests the constraint. In this case, the test function is a lambda function (an anonymous function) that uses the `IsNotNil` object to test the value. The `IsNotNil` object likely has a `Test` method that checks if the value is not nil.\n\nThe `gomerr.Gomerr` returned by the lambda function is likely a custom error type defined in the `gomerr` package. This suggests that the `Test` method of `IsNotNil` returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` when the value is nil, indicating an error.\n\nWithout more context, it's hard to say what algorithm is used here. However, the function appears to be part of a validation or error handling system. It could be used to ensure that certain values are not nil before they are used in other parts of the application, preventing runtime errors.\n\nFor more information on Go functions, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Functions in Go](https://gobyexample.com/functions)\n- [A Tour of Go - Functions](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/24)\n- [Go by Example: Error Handling](https://gobyexample.com/errors) \n\nFor more information on Go interfaces, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Interfaces in Go](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [A Tour of Go - Interfaces](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9) \n\nFor more information on lambda functions in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Anonymous Functions and Closures](https://go.dev/play/p/0pXvrIGEKn0)\n- [A Tour of Go - Function Closures](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/25)"

It returns a `Constraint` by calling the `New` function (which is not defined in the provided code but is presumably defined elsewhere in the same package). \n\nThe `New` function takes three parameters: a name, a nil value (which could be a placeholder for an additional parameter in the actual implementation), and an anonymous function that takes an `interface{}` type parameter `toTest` and returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` (presumably an error type defined in the `gomerr` package). \n\nThe anonymous function uses the `reflect` package's `ValueOf` function to get a `reflect.Value` of `toTest`, and then it checks if this value is a zero value using the `IsZero` method. If the value is zero and `errorIfZero` is `true`, or if the value is not zero and `errorIfZero` is `false`, it returns a `NotSatisfied` error (presumably defined elsewhere in the package), otherwise it returns `nil` indicating no error.\n\nThe `IsZero` and `IsNotZero` global variables are instances of `Constraint` that use `zeroConstraint` with `errorIfZero` set to `false` and `true` respectively. These variables can be used elsewhere in the code to check if a value is zero or not zero and return an error if the check fails.\n\nThis code doesn't seem to use any specific algorithm, it's more of a utility or helper function to enforce certain constraints on values in the code. It uses reflection to get the value of any type of variable and check if it's a zero value.\n\nFor more information on Go's `reflect` package and zero values, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Zero Value in Go](https://dave.cheney.net/2013/01/19/what-is-the-zero-value-and-why-is-it-useful)\n  \nThis code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for Go code. It doesn't seem to conflict with any architectural guidelines based on the provided information."

This function is a factory function that creates a `Constraint` object.\n\nThe `Zero` function calls another function, `New`, passing it three arguments:\n\n1. A string \"Zero\", which might be used as an identifier or a description of the constraint.\n2. The `value` pointer that was passed to `Zero`.\n3. An anonymous function that takes an empty interface as an argument and returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` value.\n\nThis anonymous function is a closure that captures the `value` variable from its surrounding scope. When this function is called, it calls the `Test` method of `IsZero` on the dereferenced `value` and returns the result. \n\nThe `gomerr.Gomerr` type is likely a custom error type used in the project. The `IsZero` object is likely a defined constraint that checks if a value is zero.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this function doesn't seem to use any complex ones. It performs a simple test on a value and wraps the result in a `Constraint` object.\n\nThe architectural guidelines mentioned do not provide any specific constraints or guidelines, so it's hard to comment on the consistency or conflicts between the code and the guidelines. However, this function seems to follow good Go practices. It uses interfaces, which provide flexibility, and it uses closures, which can encapsulate state.\n\nFor more information on Go functions, interfaces, and error handling, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go: Functions](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/24)\n- [A Tour of Go: Interfaces](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)"

A `Constraint` is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the codebase, which is used to enforce certain conditions or restrictions on the data. This function is used to check if the provided value is not zero.\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n- `func NotZero(value *interface{}) Constraint {`: The function `NotZero` takes a pointer to an `interface{}` as an argument. In Go, `interface{}` is an empty interface that can hold values of any type. The function returns a `Constraint`.\n\n- `return New(\"NotZero\", value, func(interface{}) gomerr.Gomerr {`: The function returns a new `Constraint` by calling a function `New()`. This function is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase. It takes three arguments: a string \"NotZero\", the `value` passed to `NotZero()`, and an anonymous function.\n\n- `return IsNotZero.Test(*value)`: The anonymous function returns the result of calling the `Test()` method on `IsNotZero` with the dereferenced `value` as the argument. `IsNotZero` is likely a predefined object or package in the codebase that checks if a value is not zero.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this code is using a validation algorithm to check if the input value is not zero. The exact details of this algorithm would depend on the implementation of `IsNotZero.Test()` method.\n\nAs for architectural guidelines, this code seems to follow common Go idioms and best practices. It uses interfaces to allow for flexibility in the types that can be passed to the `NotZero()` function, and it uses a function to encapsulate the creation of a new `Constraint`, which can help to ensure consistency and hide complexity.\n\nFor more information on Go programming, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)\n- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)\n- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)"

This code seems to be part of a larger validation system.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n- `var Required = New(\"Required\", nil, func(toTest interface{}) gomerr.Gomerr {...})` \n\n  This line is declaring a global variable named `Required` of an unspecified type. The type of `Required` is inferred from the return type of the `New` function. The `New` function is called with three arguments: a string `\"Required\"`, `nil`, and an anonymous function.\n\n- `\"Required\"` \n\n  This is a string that most likely serves as an identifier for the validation rule being created.\n\n- `nil` \n\n  The second argument is `nil`. Without more context, it's hard to say what this argument is used for but it could be a placeholder for optional arguments or configuration options for the `New` function.\n\n- `func(toTest interface{}) gomerr.Gomerr {...}` \n\n  This is an anonymous function (or lambda function) that takes a single argument `toTest` of type `interface{}` (which means it can be any type) and returns a value of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. `gomerr.Gomerr` is most likely a custom error type used by the `gomerr` package.\n\nInside the anonymous function:\n\n- `ttv, ok := flect.ReadableIndirectValue(toTest)` \n\n  This line is calling a function named `ReadableIndirectValue` from the `flect` package. This function takes an `interface{}` as an argument and returns two values: a readable indirect value (`ttv`) and a boolean (`ok`). The `flect` package seems to be a utility package for reflection in Go. Reflection in Go is a way to inspect and manipulate variables at runtime.\n\n- `if !ok || ttv.IsZero() {...}` \n\n  This is an if-statement that checks if `ok` is `false` or if the indirect value `ttv` is zero. If either condition is true, it returns `NotSatisfied(toTest)`; otherwise, it returns `nil`. `NotSatisfied` is likely another function in the same package that returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` indicating the validation failed. If the validation passes, it returns `nil` which in Go is often used to indicate no error occurred.\n\nIn summary, this code appears to define a validation rule named `Required` that checks if a given value is non-zero and readable. If the value fails this check, it returns a `gomerr.Gomerr` error indicating the validation failed.\n\nFor more information and education on Go, you can refer to:\n\n- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)\n- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)\n- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)"

This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data.\n\n   **Solution**: Implement proper access controls and object reference mapping. This can be done by ensuring that only authorized users can access the required objects. Also, consider using UUID instead of direct references.
