It imports several packages, including built-in ones like `fmt`, `reflect`, `strings`, and custom ones like `github.com/jt0/gomer/flect` and `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr`.\n\nThe package defines a map named `built` where the keys are strings and the values are of type `Constraint`. The keys represent different constraint types and the values are the actual constraints.\n\nThe constraints defined are:\n\n- `Empty`: This might represent a constraint where a value is expected to be empty.\n- `NonEmpty`: This might represent a constraint where a value is expected to be non-empty.\n- `IsRegexp`: This might represent a constraint where a value is expected to be a valid regular expression.\n- `IsNil`: This might represent a constraint where a value is expected to be `nil`.\n- `IsNotNil`: This might represent a constraint where a value is expected to be not `nil`.\n- `Required`: This might represent a constraint where a value is required.\n- `IsZero`: This might represent a constraint where a value is expected to be zero.\n- `IsNotZero`: This might represent a constraint where a value is expected to be non-zero.\n\nThe actual implementation of these constraints is not shown in the provided code, but they are likely functions or methods that perform some kind of validation check based on the constraint type.\n\nThe `reflect` package is imported, which suggests that these constraints might be applied dynamically at runtime to different types of values.\n\nThe `fmt` and `strings` packages are standard Go packages for formatted I/O and string manipulation, respectively.\n\nThe `github.com/jt0/gomer/flect` and `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr` are custom packages. The `flect` package is likely used for inflection of strings (i.e., changing the form of words based on certain rules or contexts), while the `gomerr` package is likely used for error handling.\n\nThis package seems to be part of a larger project, and these constraints are likely used throughout the project to validate data and ensure it meets certain requirements.\n\nFor more information on Go maps, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#maps.

A map is a built-in data type in Go that associates values of one type (the value type) with values of another type (the key type). This is useful when you need to look up values by a key, similar to a dictionary or a hashtable in other programming languages.\n\nIn this code, the map 'builders' has string keys and values of type 'interface{}', which means it can hold values of any type. This is because in Go, 'interface{}' is the empty interface. All types satisfy the empty interface, so we can store any value in the map, including functions.\n\nEach key in the map corresponds to a function or a constant that appears to be defined elsewhere in the codebase. These functions or constants are likely used for various types of data validation or transformation based on their names.\n\nHere is a brief explanation of what each function might do based on its name:\n\n- \"and\": It might perform a logical AND operation.\n- \"array\", \"elements\", \"slice\": These might validate or transform array elements.\n- \"endswith\", \"startswith\": These might check if a string ends or starts with a certain substring.\n- \"entries\": This might validate or transform map entries.\n- \"equals\", \"eq\": These might check if two values are equal.\n- \"float\", \"int\", \"uint\", \"time\": These might validate or transform values of these types.\n- \"floatbetween\", \"intbetween\", \"uintbetween\", \"timebetween\": These might check if a value of these types is within a certain range.\n- \"len\", \"maxlen\", \"minlen\": These might validate the length of a collection.\n- \"map\", \"mapkeys\", \"mapvalues\": These might validate or transform maps or their keys and values.\n- \"nil\", \"notnil\": These might check if a value is nil or not.\n- \"not\", \"notequals\", \"neq\", \"notzero\": These might perform logical NOT operations or check if values are not equal or not zero.\n- \"oneof\": This might check if a value is one of a set of values.\n- \"or\": This might perform a logical OR operation.\n- \"regexp\": This might validate a string against a regular expression.\n- \"typeof\": This might check the type of a value.\n- \"zero\": This might check if a value is zero.\n\nUnfortunately, without the rest of the codebase or further context, it's impossible to say exactly what each function does or how it's implemented.\n\nYou can learn more about maps in Go from the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#maps"

The function `RegisterEach` takes a map as an argument where the key is a string and the value is an interface. It uses this map to register constraints and builders.\n\nThe function begins by declaring a variable `errors` which is a slice of `gomerr.Gomerr`. `gomerr.Gomerr` is likely a custom error type defined elsewhere in the codebase. \n\nIt then iterates over the `constraintsAndBuilders` map using a `for` loop. For each key-value pair in the map, it calls the `Register` function with the `name` and `cob` as arguments. The `Register` function is expected to register the constraint or builder and return an error if there's a problem.\n\nIf the `Register` function returns an error (i.e., if `ge != nil`), the error is appended to the `errors` slice.\n\nFinally, the function returns a batched version of the errors using `gomerr.Batcher(errors)`. This function likely combines all the errors into a single error object that can be returned and handled by the caller.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a simple iteration over a map and error collection. It's a common pattern in Go when you need to perform an operation on a collection of items and collect any errors that occur.\n\nFor more about error handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog's post on the subject: [https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n\nFor more about maps in Go, you can refer to the Go documentation: [https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#maps](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#maps) \n\nThe code seems to follow standard Go practices and doesn't appear to conflict with any architectural guidelines. However, without the broader context of the software project, it's hard to make a definitive statement. The use of a custom error type (`gomerr.Gomerr`) and a function to batch errors (`gomerr.Batcher`) suggests a thoughtful approach to error handling in the project."

It accepts two parameters: a `name` of type `string` and a `constraintOrBuilder` of type `interface{}`. The function returns a `Gomerr` object, which is a custom error type in Go used to handle errors more effectively.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of what the function does:\n\n1. The function first checks if the `name` starts with a `$` symbol and if its length is between 2 and 64 characters. If not, it returns a configuration error using the `gomerr.Configuration` function. This is an example of input validation.\n\n2. It then tries to type assert `constraintOrBuilder` to `Constraint`. If the type assertion is successful, it means `constraintOrBuilder` is a `Constraint` and it adds it to the `built` map with the `name` (converted to lowercase) as the key.\n\n3. If the type assertion fails, it means `constraintOrBuilder` is not a `Constraint`. The function then tries to check if it's a builder function. It uses reflection to get the value and type of `constraintOrBuilder`. If it's not a valid function, it returns a configuration error.\n\n4. If `constraintOrBuilder` is a function, it then checks if it returns a single value that is assignable to `constraintType`. If not, it returns a configuration error.\n\n5. If `constraintOrBuilder` is a valid builder function, it adds it to the `builders` map with the `name` (converted to lowercase) as the key.\n\n6. If all checks pass and the `constraintOrBuilder` is successfully added to either the `built` or `builders` map, the function returns `nil` indicating no error.\n\nThis function uses the map data structure to store constraints and builders, and uses reflection to check the type of `constraintOrBuilder`. The Go standard library's `reflect` package provides a way to inspect the type and value of variables at runtime.\n\nFor more information on type assertions, reflection, and error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Type assertions in Go](https://tour.golang.org/methods/15)\n- [Reflection in Go](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors)"

These constraints are defined in a string format and applied using reflection.\n\nThe function accepts three parameters: \n- `validationsString`: a string that defines the constraints to be applied. \n- `op`: a logic operation type that defines how the constraints should be applied. \n- `field`: a struct field to which the constraints are applied.\n\nThe function returns a `Constraint` object and a `Gomerr` object. `Constraint` is a custom type that defines the constraints to be applied, and `Gomerr` is a custom error handling object.\n\nThe function starts by checking if the `validationsString` matches any predefined constraints in the `built` map. If it does, it checks if the type of the constraint matches the logic operation `op`. If it does, it returns the constraint and a nil error. If it doesn't, it appends the constraint to a list of constraints and clears the `validationsString`.\n\nNext, it enters a loop that continues as long as `validationsString` is not empty. In the loop, it looks for the indices of the first open parenthesis and comma in the `validationsString`. Depending on their positions, it either processes a parameterized constraint (a constraint that takes parameters, like `len(1,2)`) or a non-parameterized constraint (like `required`).\n\nFor each constraint, it appends it to the list of constraints and updates the `validationsString`.\n\nIf no constraints are found, it returns a configuration error. Otherwise, it applies the logic operation to the list of constraints and returns the result.\n\nThe logic operations are defined as follows:\n- `orOp`: returns an `Or` constraint that is satisfied if at least one of the constraints in the list is satisfied.\n- `notOp`: returns a `Not` constraint that is satisfied if none of the constraints in the list are satisfied.\n- `default`: returns an `And` constraint that is satisfied if all constraints in the list are satisfied.\n\nYou can learn more about constraints and reflection in Go from these resources:\n- [A Tutorial for Go's `reflect` Package](https://medium.com/swlh/a-tutorial-for-gos-reflect-package-9f3315c3abd7)\n- [Go by Example: Reflection](https://gobyexample.com/reflection)\n- [Go: Introduction to the `reflect` Package](https://www.loginradius.com/engineering/blog/go-introduction-to-the-reflect-package/)"

It is used to parse and build constraints based on the input string. It's a part of a system that uses reflection and constraints to validate data structures.\n\nThe function takes three parameters:\n\n- `constraintName`: a string representing the name of the constraint.\n- `parenthetical`: a pointer to a string that represents the constraint parameters enclosed in parentheses.\n- `field`: a `reflect.StructField` that represents the field on which the constraint is to be applied.\n\nThe function returns two values:\n\n- `Constraint`: an interface representing the built constraint.\n- `gomerr.Gomerr`: an error interface in case an error occurs during the building of the constraint.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable `remainder` to the string pointed by `parenthetical` and an `accumulator` to 0. It then enters a loop that continues until all parentheses in the `remainder` are balanced.\n\nIn each iteration, it checks for the index of the closing parenthesis \")\" and the opening parenthesis \"(\". If it finds an unbalanced expression, it returns an error. If it finds an opening parenthesis before a closing one, it increments the `parenCounter` and updates the `accumulator` and `remainder`. If it finds a closing parenthesis before an opening one, it decrements the `parenCounter` and updates the `accumulator` and `remainder`.\n\nAfter the loop, it extracts the parameters string from the `parenthetical` and updates the `parenthetical` to the `remainder`.\n\nFinally, it switches on the lowercased `constraintName` and calls the appropriate function to build the constraint based on the `constraintName` and the `parametersString`.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a simple string parsing algorithm to balance parentheses and extract parameters for constraints. It uses Go's built-in string functions and error handling.\n\nFor more information on Go's reflection package which is used here, you can refer to [Go's official documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/).\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, which is used here in the form of the `gomerr.Gomerr` interface, you can refer to [Go's official blog](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)."

It uses reflection to call a function registered with the provided constraint name and parameters.\n\nHere is a detailed step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The function takes three parameters: `constraintName` (the name of the constraint to build), `parametersString` (a string of parameters for the constraint), and `field` (a `reflect.StructField` representing the field on which the constraint is applied).\n\n2. It first checks if there is a builder function registered for the given constraint name in the `builders` map. If not, it returns an error using the `gomerr.Configuration` function.\n\n3. It gets the reflection `Value` and `Type` of the builder function, and checks how many input parameters it expects (`numIn`) and whether it is variadic (`isVariadic`).\n\n4. It then processes the provided parameters string, replacing any escaped commas with spaces, and splitting it into individual parameters.\n\n5. It checks if the number of provided parameters matches the number of expected parameters for the builder function, and returns an error if not.\n\n6. It creates a slice of reflection `Value` (`in`) to hold the parameters for the builder function call, and a map (`dynamicValues`) to hold any dynamic values.\n\n7. It then loops over each expected parameter for the builder function, converting each provided parameter to the appropriate type and adding it to the `in` slice. If any conversion fails, it returns an error.\n\n8. If the builder function is variadic, it processes the remaining parameters in a similar way, but treats them as a single variadic parameter.\n\n9. It then calls the builder function using the `Call` method of the reflection `Value`, passing in the `in` slice as parameters. The builder function is expected to return a `Constraint`.\n\n10. If there were any dynamic values, it wraps the `Constraint` in a `dynamicConstraint` that holds these values.\n\n11. Finally, it returns the built `Constraint` and any error that occurred.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is a form of reflection, which allows a program to inspect and manipulate its own structure and behavior at runtime. This is used to dynamically call a function based on its name and parameters.\n\nFor more information on reflection in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Go by Example: Reflection](https://gobyexample.com/reflection)\n- [Go Reflection Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect)"

It first defines two global variables `constraintType` and `nilConstraintValue` of type `reflect.Type` and `reflect.Value` respectively. `constraintType` holds the type information of the `Constraint` interface, and `nilConstraintValue` holds a zero value of the `Constraint` type. \n\n2. The function `parameterValue` takes four parameters: `pType` of type `reflect.Type`, `pString` of type `string`, `dynamicValues` of type `map[string]reflect.Value` and `field` of type `reflect.StructField`. \n\n3. The function first checks if `pType` is of type `Constraint`. If it is, and `pString` is empty, it returns `nilConstraintValue` and `nil` as the function result. If `pString` is not empty, it attempts to create a new constraint by calling the function `constraintFor` with `pString` (after replacing all commas with \"\\\\,\") as the first argument, `none` as the second argument and `field` as the third argument. If the `constraintFor` function returns an error, it returns an empty `reflect.Value` and the error. Otherwise, it returns the constraint as a `reflect.Value` and `nil`.\n\n4. If `pType` is not of type `Constraint`, it checks if `pString` starts with \"$.\". If it does, it asserts that `pType` is a pointer type. If `pType` is not a pointer type, it returns an error. If `pType` is a pointer type, it creates a new value of `pType`, sets it to a new value of the element type of `pType`, adds it to `dynamicValues` with `pString` as the key, and returns it.\n\n5. If `pString` does not start with \"$.\", the function assumes `pString` is a static parameter. It creates a new value of `pType`, sets its value to `pString` by calling the function `flect.SetValue`, and returns it. If `flect.SetValue` returns an error, it returns an empty `reflect.Value` and the error.\n\nThis function uses the Go's reflect package to manipulate types and values at runtime. It also uses the Go's error handling pattern to return potential errors.\n\nFor more information on Go's reflection and error handling, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection)\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)"
