This package likely contains various constraints or rules that can be applied to data for validation purposes. \n\nThe code defines a function `Equals` which takes a parameter `value` of type `interface{}`. This means `value` can be of any type. The function returns an instance of `Constraint`, which is likely a type defined elsewhere in the `constraint` package.\n\nThe `Equals` function creates a new `Constraint` using the `New` function (presumably defined elsewhere in the `constraint` package) with three arguments: the string \"Equals\", the input `value`, and a function that takes an `interface{}` and returns a `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\n`gomerr.Gomerr` is likely a custom error type defined in the `gomerr` package. This package is imported at the beginning of the code snippet and is likely used throughout the project for error handling.\n\nThe function passed as the third argument to `New` performs the actual constraint check. It uses `flect.IndirectInterface` to get the underlying value of `toTest` if it's a pointer. If `toTest` is not a pointer or its underlying value is not equal to `value`, the function returns `NotSatisfied(toTest)`, which is likely a function that generates a `gomerr.Gomerr` indicating the constraint was not satisfied. If `toTest` is equal to `value`, the function returns `nil`, indicating no error.\n\nIn terms of algorithms, this code doesn't use any complex ones. It primarily uses equality comparison and pointer dereferencing.\n\nThe code appears to align with common Go practices. It makes good use of interfaces to allow for flexibility and leverages a custom error type for detailed error information.\n\nFor more information on Go interfaces, you can refer to the official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#interfaces.

The function is named `NotEquals` and it takes an `interface{}` type as an argument. This function returns a `Constraint`, which is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the code.\n\nThe `NotEquals` function uses a closure to define the constraint. This closure takes a value to test (`toTest`) and returns an error of type `gomerr.Gomerr` if the constraint is not satisfied. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the closure:\n\n1. `tt, ok := flect.IndirectInterface(toTest)`: This line uses the `flect` package's `IndirectInterface` function to get the actual value of `toTest` if it is a pointer. The function returns two values: the possibly indirected value (`tt`) and a boolean (`ok`) that is `false` if the value couldn't be indirected (i.e., it's not a pointer).\n\n2. `!ok || tt == value`: This condition checks if the `toTest` value couldn't be indirected or if it equals the `value` passed to the `NotEquals` function. If either condition is true, the constraint is not satisfied.\n\n3. `return NotSatisfied(toTest)`: If the constraint is not satisfied, this line returns an error of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. The `NotSatisfied` function likely creates this error and includes `toTest` as part of the error message.\n\n4. `return nil`: If the constraint is satisfied, the closure returns `nil`, indicating no error.\n\nIn summary, this function creates a constraint that checks if a value is not equal to a specified value. It uses the `flect` package to handle indirect interfaces (pointers), and the `gomerr` package to handle errors.\n\nFor more information on Go's interfaces, you can refer to [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9).\n\nFor more information on Go's closures, you can refer to [Go by Example: Closures](https://gobyexample.com/closures).\n\nPlease note that `flect` and `gomerr` are likely custom packages used in this project, and you might need to look at their source code or documentation for more detailed understanding."

It checks if a given value is one of the specified values. The function uses reflection to check the type of the values and to convert the value to test to the same type as the specified values. The code also uses a custom error type `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\nThe algorithm in this function can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. The function takes a variadic parameter `values`. This means it can accept any number of arguments of any type.\n\n2. If no values are provided, the function panics with a custom error message using `gomerr.Configuration`.\n\n3. The function gets the type of the first value in the `values` slice using `reflect.TypeOf`.\n\n4. The function returns a new `Constraint` which is a function that takes an `interface{}` type parameter `toTest`.\n\n5. Inside the `Constraint` function, it checks if `toTest` can be read and is not a nil pointer or interface using `flect.ReadableIndirectValue`. If it's not readable, it returns a `NotSatisfied` error.\n\n6. If `toTest` can be converted to the type of `values` using `ttv.CanConvert(valuesType)`, it does the conversion and compares the converted `toTest` value with each value in `values`. If a match is found, the function returns `nil`, indicating no error.\n\n7. If `toTest` cannot be converted to `valuesType`, or if no match is found in the `values` slice, the function returns a `NotSatisfied` error.\n\nThe `flect` package used in this code is likely a utility package in the same project or a third-party package that provides helper functions for reflection. The `gomerr` package is likely a custom error handling package in the same project.\n\nThis function is an example of a constraint function that can be used in data validation. It ensures that a value is one of the specified values, which can be useful in many scenarios such as checking if a string is one of the allowed strings, or if a number is one of the allowed numbers.\n\nFor more information on the topics used in this code, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Variadic Functions](https://gobyexample.com/variadic-functions)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n- [Go by Example: Reflection](https://gobyexample.com/reflection)\n- [Ardan Labs: Using the reflect Package in Go](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/05/using-the-reflect-package-in-go.html)"
