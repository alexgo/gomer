Go is known for its simplicity and efficiency, and is commonly used for building server-side applications.\n\nThe code defines a new error type `NotSatisfiedError` in the `constraint` package. This error type is defined as a struct with the following fields:\n\n- `gomerr.Gomerr`: This is an embedded field. `Gomerr` is a custom error handling package used in this project. By embedding `Gomerr` in `NotSatisfiedError`, `NotSatisfiedError` inherits the methods of `Gomerr`. This is a common pattern in Go for creating new types that extend or modify the behavior of existing types.\n- `ToTest`: This field represents the data that was being tested when the error occurred. The `gomerr:\"include_type\"` tag indicates that the type of `ToTest` should be included when the error is formatted into a string.\n- `Target`: This field is a string that presumably represents the target of the constraint that was not satisfied.\n- `Constraint`: This field is of type `Constraint`. The `Constraint` type is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is presumably defined elsewhere in the `constraint` package.\n\nThe `NotSatisfiedError` type is likely used throughout the `constraint` package to indicate that a given constraint was not satisfied. The specific constraint that was not satisfied, the target of the constraint, and the data that was being tested are all included in the error, which would make it easier to debug issues.\n\nThe algorithmic complexity of this code is O(1), or constant time, because it involves only the creation of a struct. \n\nFor more information on Go's error handling, you can refer to this link: [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go).

The function takes a single parameter `toTest` of the type `interface{}`. In Go, `interface{}` is an empty interface that can hold values of any type. This makes `toTest` a very flexible parameter that can accept any kind of data.\n\nThe function returns a pointer to a `NotSatisfiedError` struct. This suggests that `NotSatisfiedError` is a custom error type defined elsewhere in the code. The use of a custom error type allows for more detailed and specific error handling.\n\nInside the function, the `gomerr.Build` function is called with two arguments: `new(NotSatisfiedError)` and `toTest`. The `new` keyword in Go creates a new instance of a type and returns a pointer to it. Here, `new(NotSatisfiedError)` creates a new instance of `NotSatisfiedError`.\n\nThe `gomerr.Build` function is from the `gomerr` package. Based on the name, it's likely that this package provides tools for creating and managing errors in Go. The `Build` function probably constructs a new error of the type provided as the first argument, and using the data provided as the second argument.\n\nThe result of `gomerr.Build` is then type-asserted to `*NotSatisfiedError` using the `.(*NotSatisfiedError)` syntax. This is necessary because `gomerr.Build` returns a value of type `interface{}`, but the `NotSatisfied` function needs to return a `*NotSatisfiedError`.\n\nThe purpose of this function is likely to create a new `NotSatisfiedError` with some associated data, for use in error handling elsewhere in the application.\n\nUnfortunately, without the rest of the codebase, it's hard to provide more specific details about the `gomerr` package or the `NotSatisfiedError` type. However, the function's structure and usage of Go's features is quite clear.\n\nFor more information on Go's error handling and the use of `interface{}`, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [The Go Programming Language Specification: Interface types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Interface_types)"
