This function is used to assert that a certain condition is true during testing. If the condition is not true, it will print an error message and stop the test immediately.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The code is part of the package `assert`.\n\n2. It imports several packages: `errors`, `fmt`, `reflect`, and `testing` from the Go Standard Library, and `github.com/jt0/gomer/gomerr` which is an external package used for error handling.\n\n3. The `Assert` function is defined with three parameters:\n   - `tb` is of type `testing.TB`, an interface common to `T` and `B`, which are types used by the `testing` package in Go.\n   - `condition` is a boolean that represents the condition to be tested.\n   - `msgAndArgs` is a variadic parameter (indicated by `...`), meaning it can take any number of arguments. These arguments are used to format an error message if the condition is false.\n\n4. Inside the `Assert` function, it first checks if there is a message provided in `msgAndArgs`. If there is, it assigns the first argument to `msg` and the rest to `msgArgs`.\n\n5. It then checks if the `condition` is false. If it is, it prints an error message using `fmt.Printf`. The error message is formatted using `msg` and `msgArgs`. After that, it calls `tb.FailNow()` to indicate that the test has failed and to stop it immediately.\n\nThe algorithm used in this code is relatively simple. It mainly involves checking a condition and handling the result.\n\nThis code follows common Go testing practices. You can learn more about testing in Go from the official Go blog: https://blog.golang.org/subtests."

The function is named `Success` and it takes two parameters. The first parameter `tb` is of type `testing.TB`, which is an interface common to T (test case) and B (benchmark) in Go's testing package. It provides methods for logging and signaling test failures. The second parameter `err` is of type `error`, which is the built-in interface type for error handling in Go.\n\n- `if err != nil`: This is a conditional statement that checks if the `err` parameter is not `nil`. In Go, `nil` is the zero value for pointers, interfaces, maps, slices, channels and function types, representing an uninitialized value or absence of a value. In the context of error handling, a `nil` error usually signifies that no error has occurred.\n\n- `fmt.Printf(\"Expected success, but got: %s\\n\", errString(err))`: If the `err` is not `nil`, meaning an error has occurred, this line will print a formatted error message to the standard output. The `%s` is a placeholder for a string argument, which in this case is the string representation of the error returned by the `errString(err)` function. Note that `errString()` is not a built-in function and is not shown in the provided code, so we can assume it's a helper function defined elsewhere in the code that takes an error and returns its string representation.\n\n- `tb.FailNow()`: This method is part of the `testing.TB` interface. It marks the test as failed and stops its execution immediately. This is typically used when an unexpected error is encountered during a test.\n\nThis function does not use any specific algorithm, it is a simple conditional function used in testing to handle and assert error situations.\n\nFor more information on Go testing, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go Testing package](https://pkg.go.dev/testing)\n- [How to use Go interfaces](https://jordanorelli.com/post/32665860244/how-to-use-interfaces-in-go)\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)"

The function `Fail` takes two arguments: `tb` of type `testing.TB` and `err` of type `error`. The `testing.TB` is an interface that is implemented by the `*testing.T` and `*testing.B` types in the Go testing package, and it provides methods for error reporting and logging in tests.\n\nThe function `Fail` checks if the `err` argument is `nil`. If `err` is `nil`, it means that no error has occurred, which is not the expected outcome in this case. Therefore, a message \"Expected an error, but err is nil\" is printed to the standard output, and then the test is terminated immediately by calling the `FailNow` method on `tb`.\n\nThe `FailNow` method is provided by the `testing.TB` interface and it marks the test as failed and stops its execution. Note that `FailNow` does not stop the execution of other tests in the same package, it only stops the current test.\n\nThis function is typically used in situations where you want to ensure that a certain operation in your code is supposed to produce an error. If the operation does not produce an error, the test will fail. This is a common pattern in Go testing, especially when testing error handling in your code.\n\nThere are no specific algorithms used in this function, it's a simple conditional check followed by an action based on the result of the check.\n\nFor more information on Go testing, you can refer to the official Go documentation on testing: https://golang.org/pkg/testing/"

It is used to assert that an error is expected in a specific part of the code during testing. If an error does not occur where it is expected, the test will fail.\n\nHere is the detailed explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function `Error` takes three parameters:\n   - `tb`: This is an interface of type `testing.TB`, which is a common interface for the `*testing.T` and `*testing.B` types in Go's testing package. It provides methods for error reporting and logging during tests or benchmarks.\n   - `err`: This is the error that is being tested. The function expects this error to be non-nil for the test to pass.\n   - `msgAndArgs`: This is a variadic parameter (indicated by `...`), which can take zero or more arguments of any type (`interface{}`). These arguments are used to format a custom error message if the test fails.\n\n2. Next, the function initializes two variables, `msg` and `msgArgs`.\n\n3. The function then checks if there are any arguments provided in `msgAndArgs`. If there are, it assumes the first argument is a string and assigns it to `msg`. If there are more than one arguments, it assigns the rest of the arguments to `msgArgs`.\n\n4. The function then checks if `err` is `nil`. If it is, it means that an error was expected but did not occur. In this case, it prints an error message using `fmt.Printf`, formats the message with any arguments provided, and then calls `tb.FailNow()`. The `FailNow` method marks the test as failed and stops its execution immediately.\n\nThe function does not use any specific algorithms, but it uses the standard library's `fmt` package for formatting strings and the `testing` package for handling tests.\n\nFor more information on testing in Go, you can refer to the official Go documentation on testing: https://golang.org/pkg/testing/."

If it's not, the function will print an error message and fail the test. \n\nThe function takes four arguments: \n\n1. `tb`: An interface representing the test or benchmark function. This is used to call `FailNow()` which indicates that the test has failed and should not continue.\n2. `err`: The error that needs to be checked.\n3. `target`: The expected type of the error.\n4. `msgAndArgs`: A variadic parameter that can take an optional error message and additional arguments. This message will be printed if the error is not of the expected type.\n\nThe function starts by checking if a custom message has been provided in `msgAndArgs`. If yes, it separates the message from any additional arguments.\n\nNext, it checks if `err` is `nil`. If it is, it prints a message stating that an error was expected, and calls `tb.FailNow()` to stop the test.\n\nThe function then uses the `errors.Is()` function to check if `err` is of the same type as `target`. \n\nIf `err` is a `BatchError`, a type of error that contains multiple errors, and `err` is not of the same type as `target`, it loops through each error in the batch and recursively calls `ErrorType` to check each error.\n\nIf `err` is not a `BatchError`, or if it is a `BatchError` but of the same type as `target`, and `err` is not of the same type as `target`, it prints a message stating that the wrong error type was received, and calls `tb.FailNow()` to stop the test.\n\nThis function does not appear to use any specific algorithms, but it does use recursion to handle batch errors. \n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the official Go blog post on the topic: https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go.

If they are not equal, it prints an error message and fails the test immediately. \n\nHere's a step by step explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function `Equals` takes four parameters. The first one is `tb`, which is of type `testing.TB`. This is an interface type that is satisfied by types `*testing.T` and `*testing.B`, and is used for error reporting and logging during tests. The second and third parameters are `expected` and `actual` of type `interface{}`, which means they can be any type. The last parameter is `msgAndArgs` which is a variadic parameter of type `interface{}`. This means it can accept any number of arguments of any type.\n\n2. The `reflect.DeepEqual` function is used to check if `expected` and `actual` are deeply equal. This function checks public and private fields, following pointers, arrays and slices, and is therefore more thorough than the `==` operator.\n\n3. If `expected` and `actual` are not equal, an error message is generated. The error message is constructed from `msgAndArgs`. If `msgAndArgs` has at least one argument, the first argument is used as the error message. If `msgAndArgs` has more than one argument, the remaining arguments are used as formatting arguments for the error message.\n\n4. The `fmt.Printf` function is then used to print the error message, along with the expected and actual values. The `append` function is used to construct the argument slice for `fmt.Printf`.\n\n5. Finally, `tb.FailNow` is called to indicate that the test has failed and should stop immediately. This is equivalent to calling `tb.Log` followed by `tb.FailNow`.\n\nThis function is a common testing utility in Go, and is similar to the `assert.Equal` function in the `testify/assert` package.\n\nFor more information on testing in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Testing in Go](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/)\n- [Deep equality check in Go](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#DeepEqual)\n- [Formatting in Go](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/)\n- [Variadic Functions in Go](https://gobyexample.com/variadic-functions)"

This function is used to assert that two values are not equal. If they are equal, it reports a failure with a detailed message and stops the test. \n\nThe function takes four parameters:\n- `tb`: A testing object, which is used to report failures. It's of type `testing.TB`, which is an interface common to `T` and `B`, allowing functions to take either as a parameter.\n- `expected`: The expected value in the test.\n- `actual`: The actual value produced by the code under test.\n- `msgAndArgs`: A variadic parameter that can accept an optional custom error message and formatting arguments.\n\nThe function uses the `reflect.DeepEqual` function to compare the expected and actual values. `DeepEqual` is a function provided by Go's `reflect` package. It checks if two values are deeply equal, meaning it compares the actual data of the values, not their addresses. It's a common way to compare complex data types in Go.\n\nIf `expected` and `actual` are equal, the function constructs a failure message. It first checks if a custom message was provided in `msgAndArgs`. If so, it formats the message with the provided arguments. Then it appends the expected and actual values to the message. The formatted message is printed to the standard output using `fmt.Printf`.\n\nFinally, the function calls `tb.FailNow`, which marks the test as failed and stops its execution. This is a method provided by the `testing.TB` interface.\n\nTo learn more about testing in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n- [Go testing package](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/)\n- [Go reflect package](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/)\n- [A tutorial on testing in Go](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)"

It is a utility function that takes an `error` type argument and returns a `string`. The purpose of this function is to convert an error into a string representation, which can then be used for logging, debugging, or displaying the error message to the user.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function `errString` accepts an argument `err` of type `error`. `error` is a built-in interface type in Go, which is used to represent an error state. Any type that defines a method `Error() string` is said to implement the `error` interface.\n\n2. Inside the function, a type assertion is performed on `err` to check if it is of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. `gomerr.Gomerr` is a custom error type, defined elsewhere in the code. The syntax `err.(gomerr.Gomerr)` is a type assertion in Go, which checks if the interface value `err` holds a value of type `gomerr.Gomerr`.\n\n3. If the type assertion is successful (i.e., if `err` is of type `gomerr.Gomerr`), `ok` will be `true`, and `ge` will hold the `gomerr.Gomerr` value. In this case, the function returns the string representation of `ge` by calling the `String()` method on `ge`, prefixed by a newline. The `String()` method is likely defined on the `Gomerr` type and should return a string representation of the `Gomerr` error.\n\n4. If the type assertion is not successful (i.e., if `err` is not of type `gomerr.Gomerr`), `ok` will be `false`, and the function will return the string representation of `err` by calling the `Error()` method on `err`. The `Error()` method is defined on all types that implement the `error` interface and returns a string representation of the error.\n\nThe algorithm used in this function is quite simple: it checks the type of the error and returns the string representation of the error accordingly. \n\nThis function aligns with the Go best practices of error handling. It allows for specific handling of custom error types (`gomerr.Gomerr` in this case), while also gracefully handling all other error types.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n- [Go's `error` type](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go)"
