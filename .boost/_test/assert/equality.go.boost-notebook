The comparison is not based on byte equality, which means the order of elements in the JSON objects doesn't matter. \n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The package `assert` is declared at the beginning. This means that the functions defined in this file are part of the `assert` package.\n\n2. Multiple packages are imported for use in this file, including `encoding/json` for JSON processing, `fmt` for formatting output, `strconv` for conversions between string and other data types, and `testing` which provides support for automated testing of Go packages.\n\n3. The `JsonEqual` function is defined, which accepts a `testing.TB` interface (which can be a testing object from the `testing` package), two byte slices (`expected` and `actual`) containing JSON data, and an optional message (`msg`).\n\n4. Inside the `JsonEqual` function, `expected` and `actual` byte slices are unmarshalled (decoded) into `expectedMap` and `actualMap` variables respectively, which are maps with string keys and values of any type (`interface{}`). If there's an error in unmarshalling, the `Success` function is called with the testing object and the error, presumably to handle the error.\n\n5. A helper function `mapsEqual` is called with the two maps and an empty string. This function is not defined in the provided code, but based on the context, it likely compares the two maps for equality.\n\n6. If `mapsEqual` returns `false`, meaning the two JSON objects are not equal, a failure message is printed using `fmt.Println` and the test is terminated immediately using `tb.FailNow()`.\n\nThis code doesn't seem to use any specific algorithm, but it uses the JSON decoding feature of the `encoding/json` package to convert JSON data into Go data structures, and presumably compares these structures for equality.\n\nFor more information on Go testing and JSON handling, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go Testing package](https://pkg.go.dev/testing)\n- [Go JSON package](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json)"

It only contains a comment explaining the purpose of a function named `mapsEqual`. According to the comment, `mapsEqual` is a function that accepts two maps with string keys and values of any type (`map[string]interface{}`). The function walks through both maps to compare their keys and values. If there are any mismatches, it will return false, indicating that the maps are not equal.\n\nHowever, without the actual implementation of the function, it's not possible to provide a detailed explanation or analysis of the algorithms used. The implementation would detail how the function walks through the maps and how it compares the keys and values. \n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since there are no special guidelines or constraints provided, we would typically expect this function to follow standard Go practices for map comparison. \n\nFor more information on working with maps in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go Maps in Action](https://go.dev/blog/maps)\n- [A Tour of Go: Maps](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/19)"

It checks whether the keys and values in both maps are the same.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the function:\n\n1. The function takes three parameters: `expected` and `actual` are the two maps to be compared, and `path` is a string that helps track the path to the current key when the function is called recursively.\n\n2. If either `expected` or `actual` is `nil`, the function checks if both are `nil`. If they are, the function returns `true` (since two `nil` maps can be considered equal). If only one of them is `nil`, a message is printed, and the function returns `false`.\n\n3. The function creates two variables `m1` and `m2` to hold the `expected` and `actual` maps, and a boolean `equal` set to `true`.\n\n4. The function checks the length of both maps. If they don't have the same number of elements, it prints a message, sets `equal` to `false`, and flips `m1` and `m2` if `actual` has more elements than `expected`.\n\n5. Then, the function iterates over the map `m1`. For each key-value pair, it checks if the key exists in `m2`. If not, it prints a message and continues to the next iteration.\n\n6. If the key exists in both maps, it checks the type of the value in `m1`.\n\n    - If the value is a map, it recursively calls `mapsEqual` with the nested maps and the updated path. The result of this call is combined with the current `equal` value using a logical AND operation.\n    \n    - If the value is a slice of `interface{}`, it checks if the lengths of the slices in both maps are equal. If not, it prints a message and sets `equal` to `false`. Then, it iterates over the slice from `m1` and compares each element with the corresponding element in `m2`. If the elements are maps, it recursively calls `mapsEqual`. If they are of different types, it prints a message and sets `equal` to `false`.\n    \n    - If the value is of any other type, it directly compares the values in `m1` and `m2`. If they are not equal, it prints a message and sets `equal` to `false`.\n\n7. Finally, the function returns the `equal` variable, which will be `true` if all keys and values in both maps are equal, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThis function uses recursion to handle nested maps and slices, and a form of the Depth-First Search algorithm to traverse the maps.\n\nFor more information about maps in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [A Tour of Go: Maps](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/19)\n- [Go by Example: Maps](https://gobyexample.com/maps)\n- [Effective Go: Maps](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#maps)"
