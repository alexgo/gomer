It imports two packages - `data` and `gomerr` - from a GitHub repository named `jt0/gomer`.\n\nThe code declares a global variable `PanicStore` of type `panicStore`. The `panicStore` is a struct type defined in the same package. It's an empty struct, which means it doesn't have any fields.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. `package stores`: This line declares the name of the package that this file belongs to. In Go, all the files in the same directory must belong to the same package.\n\n2. `import`: The `import` keyword is used to include code from other packages. This code imports two packages, `data` and `gomerr`, from a GitHub repository `jt0/gomer`. The `data` package likely contains data structures or functions for handling data, while `gomerr` is likely a custom error handling package.\n\n3. `var PanicStore panicStore`: This line declares a global variable `PanicStore` of type `panicStore`. This variable is exported (because it starts with a capital letter), which means it can be accessed from other packages. The `panicStore` type is defined in the next line.\n\n4. `type panicStore struct{}`: This line defines a new type `panicStore` as an empty struct. In Go, a struct is a collection of fields. An empty struct doesn't have any fields, but it can still be useful as a type to implement methods on.\n\nThe purpose of this code isn't clear from the snippet alone, but it's likely that `PanicStore` is used as a singleton instance of `panicStore`, and that methods are implemented on the `panicStore` type elsewhere in the `stores` package.\n\nAs for algorithms, there aren't any algorithms used in this code snippet. It's mostly declarations and type definitions.\n\nFor more information on Go packages and imports, you can refer to the Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Packages\n\nFor more information on Go structs and types, you can refer to the Go documentation: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Struct_types"

The function is named `Create` and it accepts an argument of type `data.Persistable`. It returns a value of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. \n\nThe `data.Persistable` is likely an interface for data that can be persisted (saved) in some form of storage, though without more context, it's impossible to say exactly what that interface might look like.\n\nThe `gomerr.Gomerr` is a custom error type from the `gomerr` package. This package is designed to provide more flexible error handling in Go, allowing for richer error information and easier error wrapping.\n\nThe function body contains a single line of code: `panic(\"As promised\")`. The `panic` function in Go is a built-in function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking. When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller.\n\nIn this case, the panic message is \"As promised\", which suggests that the function is intentionally designed to panic whenever it is called. This would typically be done for testing purposes, or as a placeholder for code that has not yet been implemented.\n\nThere are no specific algorithms used in this function, as it consists of a single command to panic.\n\nFor more information about panic and error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Panic](https://gobyexample.com/panic)\n- [Effective Go: Panic](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#panic)\n- [Go Blog: Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [GoDoc: gomerr](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bdlm/gomerr@v0.0.0-20190204155355-8c6a9d842ebe)"

This function takes an argument of type `data.Persistable` and returns a value of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. \n\nThe `Read` function is designed to panic with the message \"As promised\". The `panic` function in Go is a built-in function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking. When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller. \n\nIn this case, the `Read` function doesn't do anything with the `data.Persistable` argument it receives. It is designed to panic immediately when called, which is not typical behavior for a `Read` function. Usually, a `Read` function would read some data from a data source and return it or an error if there was a problem.\n\nThe `gomerr.Gomerr` type appears to be a custom error type from a package named `gomerr`. Custom error types in Go are usually used to add more context or functionality to errors. Without more information, it's hard to say exactly what additional capabilities this `gomerr.Gomerr` type might provide.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this function is a method of a type named `panicStore`. This suggests that this type might be used to mock or simulate a data store for testing purposes. The fact that it panics when its `Read` method is called could be a way to simulate a catastrophic failure of the data store.\n\nHere are some resources for further reading:\n- [Go by Example: Panic](https://gobyexample.com/panic)\n- [Go Blog: Defer, Panic, and Recover](https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover)\n- [Creating Custom Errors in Go](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/creating-custom-errors-in-go)"

It defines a method called `Update` on a struct called `panicStore`. This method takes two arguments of the type `data.Persistable` and returns a value of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. \n\nThe `Update` method immediately calls the built-in `panic` function with the string \"As promised\". The `panic` function in Go stops the ordinary flow of control, begins panicking, and when the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller.\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since there are no additional special architectural guidelines or constraints provided for this software project, we can only analyze it based on general Go programming best practices. \n\nHere, the `panic` function is generally used to fail fast on errors that shouldn’t occur during normal operation, or that aren’t prepared to handle gracefully. In this case, it's being used to indicate that the `Update` method is not implemented or not supposed to be called.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that using `panic` is not a common way to handle errors in Go. The idiomatic way to handle errors in Go is to return an error as the last return value of a function and to check that error in the calling function.\n\nAs for the types `data.Persistable` and `gomerr.Gomerr`, without more context, we can only infer that `data.Persistable` is likely an interface defining methods for data that can be persisted (saved to a database or file system, for example), and `gomerr.Gomerr` is likely a custom error type, possibly from the \"gomerr\" package.\n\nFor more information on error handling and the `panic` function in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Defer, Panic, and Recover](https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover)"

This function is a method of the struct `panicStore`.\n\nThis function, `Delete`, takes an argument of type `data.Persistable` and returns a value of type `gomerr.Gomerr`. The `data.Persistable` type suggests that this function is intended to delete a persistable data object, possibly representing a record in a database or other persistent storage. \n\nThe `gomerr.Gomerr` type is a custom error type from the `gomerr` package, which is a Go package for creating and handling errors. This indicates that the function will return a `gomerr.Gomerr` error if something goes wrong during execution.\n\nThe function body contains a single line, `panic(\"As promised\")`. The `panic` function in Go is a built-in function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking. When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller. To the caller, F then behaves like a call to panic. The process continues up the stack until all functions in the current goroutine have returned, at which point the program crashes. Panics are typically triggered when an unrecoverable error occurs, or during debugging.\n\nThe string \"As promised\" passed to `panic` will be the message displayed when the panic occurs. The name of the struct `panicStore` and the panic message suggest that this is a mock or placeholder implementation, used for testing or as a stand-in until a real implementation is provided.\n\nThis function doesn't seem to be using any complex algorithms, and it's not clear from this snippet alone what the broader architecture of the software project might be. However, it appears to be consistent with Go's error handling philosophy, which encourages functions to return errors as their last return value.\n\nFor more information on Go's panic and error handling, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Panic](https://gobyexample.com/panic)\n- [Go Blog: Error handling and Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [GoDoc: gomerr package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bdlm/gomerr@v0.0.2)"

When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller. To the caller, F then behaves like a call to panic. The process continues up the stack until all functions in the current goroutine have returned, at which point the program crashes. Panics can be initiated by invoking panic directly. They can also be caused by runtime errors, such as out-of-bounds array accesses.\n\n   **Solution**: Avoid using panic for normal error handling. Use error handling and return errors instead.
