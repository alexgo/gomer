The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. \n\nHowever, the analysis has identified a potential issue related to high memory usage in the file `_test/helpers/resource.go`. This issue is associated with the use of `json.Unmarshal`, which can lead to high memory usage, especially when unmarshalling large JSON payloads. \n\n### Potential Customer Impact\n\nThe identified issue could potentially impact customers who are dealing with large JSON payloads. High memory usage could lead to performance degradation or even system crashes in extreme cases, affecting the reliability and usability of the software.\n\n### Overall Issues\n\nThe analysis has identified one file with a warning level issue. However, it's important to note that this is based on the limited scope of the analysis and the actual number of issues could be higher.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall health of the project source appears to be good, with only one file identified as having an issue. However, the severity of the issue is at a warning level, indicating a potential risk that needs to be addressed.\n\n### Highlights\n\n- The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- A potential issue related to high memory usage has been identified in the file `_test/helpers/resource.go`.\n- The identified issue could potentially impact customers dealing with large JSON payloads.\n- The overall health of the project source appears to be good, with only one file identified as having an issue.\n- The severity of the identified issue is at a warning level, indicating a potential risk that needs to be addressed.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Consider using a streaming JSON decoder such as `json.Decoder` if dealing with large JSON payloads. This allows you to process the JSON data as it is read, reducing memory usage.\n- Conduct a more comprehensive code review and testing to identify and address any other potential issues.",

It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns. However, there is a significant issue in the `_test/helpers/resource.go` file related to data validation, which could potentially impact the overall architecture if not addressed.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The project has a high-risk issue related to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance. The function `Unmarshal` in `_test/helpers/resource.go` does not validate the incoming data before processing it. This could lead to processing of personal data without the necessary checks and balances in place, which is a violation of GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. This issue needs immediate attention to mitigate the risk of non-compliance.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The non-compliance issue could potentially impact customers who are subject to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS regulations. If personal data is processed without the necessary checks and balances, it could lead to regulatory penalties and loss of customer trust.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has one file with issues out of one total file, indicating that 100% of the project files have issues. The severity of the issue is categorized as a warning, which is the highest severity level. This suggests that the overall health of the project source is poor and requires immediate attention.\n\nHighlights of the Analysis:\n\n- The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- The project has a high-risk issue related to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance in the `_test/helpers/resource.go` file.\n- The non-compliance issue could potentially impact customers who are subject to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS regulations.\n- 100% of the project files have issues, with the severity of the issue categorized as a warning, indicating poor overall health of the project source.\n\nThe project does not have any additional special architectural guidelines or constraints. However, the identified issue is a significant risk that needs to be addressed to ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS regulations.",
