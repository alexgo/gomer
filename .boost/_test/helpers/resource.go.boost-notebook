It provides a function `Unmarshal` that is used to convert JSON data into a Go `Resource` object. \n\nThe `Unmarshal` function takes three parameters:\n- `resourceType` of type `reflect.Type`, which is a Go type that represents the type of the resource.\n- `subject` of type `auth.Subject`, which represents the authenticated user or system that is performing the operation.\n- `bytes` which is a slice of bytes, representing the JSON data to be unmarshalled.\n\nThe function returns two values:\n- `resource.Resource` which is the unmarshalled resource.\n- `gomerr.Gomerr` which is an error object that can be returned if an error occurs during the operation.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the function:\n\n1. It first tries to create a new resource of the specified type with the `resource.New` function, passing the `resourceType` and `subject` as arguments. If an error occurs during this operation (indicated by `ge != nil`), the function returns `nil` and the error.\n\n2. It then checks if the `bytes` slice is not empty. If it's not, it tries to unmarshal the JSON data into the newly created resource using the `json.Unmarshal` function from the `encoding/json` package. If an error occurs during this operation, it returns `nil` and wraps the error using `gomerr.Unmarshal`.\n\n3. If no errors occur, it returns the newly created and populated resource and `nil` for the error.\n\nAs for the algorithms used, JSON unmarshalling is a common operation in Go and it's handled by the `encoding/json` package. The exact algorithm used for JSON unmarshalling can be complex and depends on the JSON data and the Go type it's being unmarshalled into. However, in general, it involves parsing the JSON data and converting it into the appropriate Go types.\n\nHere are some resources for further reading:\n- [The Laws of Reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection) - a blog post about reflection in Go.\n- [JSON and Go](https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go) - a blog post about JSON encoding and decoding in Go.\n- [Go by Example: JSON](https://gobyexample.com/json) - a tutorial on JSON encoding and decoding in Go."
