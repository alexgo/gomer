It follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns by defining a `Constraint` interface and implementing different constraint types. However, the file `limit/unknown.go` has been flagged with several data compliance issues, which could potentially impact the overall architecture if not addressed. \n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The `limit/unknown.go` file has been flagged with 2 GDPR, 1 PCI DSS, 1 HIPAA, and 2 general Data Compliance issues. This indicates a high risk in terms of data compliance, which could lead to legal and financial repercussions if not addressed. Additionally, there is 1 error related to Data Privacy, which could potentially lead to a breach of sensitive data.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The issues identified could potentially impact customers in terms of data privacy and compliance. If sensitive customer data is being processed without proper safeguards, it could lead to a breach of trust and potential loss of customers.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The project has a total of 1 file, `limit/unknown.go`, which has been flagged with several issues. This indicates that 100% of the project files have issues, which is a significant concern. The issues range from Information level to Error level severity, with the most severe being related to Data Privacy.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\n- **Overall Health**: The fact that 100% of the project files have issues is a significant concern. The most severe issues are related to Data Privacy, which could potentially lead to a breach of sensitive data. This indicates a high risk in terms of the overall health of the project.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The project follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n- The `limit/unknown.go` file has been flagged with several data compliance issues, indicating a high risk in terms of data compliance.\n- There is 1 error related to Data Privacy, which could potentially lead to a breach of sensitive data.\n- 100% of the project files have issues, indicating a significant concern in terms of the overall health of the project.",
