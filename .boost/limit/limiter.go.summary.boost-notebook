It defines a `Constraint` interface and provides implementations for various constraint types. The code follows Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library. However, there is a potential GDPR violation in the `limiter.go` file, which could have architectural implications. The method `Limiter()` could potentially return sensitive data, which could require changes in the architecture to ensure data privacy and compliance with GDPR.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: The risk associated with this project is moderate. The main risk comes from potential GDPR and HIPAA violations in the `limiter.go` file. This could lead to legal and financial consequences if not addressed. The risk is further increased by potential PCI DSS and Data Privacy issues in the same file. However, it's important to note that these are potential issues and further investigation is needed to confirm them.\n\n3. **Potential Customer Impact**: The potential customer impact is high. If the GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and Data Privacy issues are confirmed, it could lead to a breach of customer's sensitive data. This could result in loss of trust, legal action, and financial loss for the customers.\n\n4. **Overall Issues**: The overall health of the project source is questionable. The `limiter.go` file has potential GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and Data Privacy issues. However, it's the only file in the project, which means 100% of the project files have potential issues. This is a significant concern and needs immediate attention.\n\nHighlights of the Analysis:\n\n- The project is a Go library for constraint handling and validation, following Go's idiomatic style and structure for a library.\n- The `limiter.go` file has potential GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and Data Privacy issues.\n- The potential issues in the `limiter.go` file could lead to a breach of customer's sensitive data, resulting in high customer impact.\n- 100% of the project files have potential issues, indicating a significant concern for the overall health of the project source.\n- The architectural impact of the potential GDPR violation could require changes in the architecture to ensure data privacy and compliance.",
