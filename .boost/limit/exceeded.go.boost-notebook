This type is used when a certain limit has been exceeded in the context of the application. \n\nThe `ExceededError` struct contains several fields:\n\n- `Gomerr`: This is an embedded field of type `gomerr.Gomerr`, which is a package for handling errors in Go. By embedding `Gomerr` in the `ExceededError` struct, `ExceededError` inherits the methods of `Gomerr`. This allows `ExceededError` to be used wherever a `Gomerr` is expected, and to have additional context-specific information. You can learn more about Go error handling and the gomerr package here: [Error Handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n\n- `Limiter`: This field is of type `interface{}`, which means it can hold any type. This could be used to hold the object or entity that is imposing the limit.\n\n- `Limited`: Similar to `Limiter`, this is an `interface{}` type field that can hold any type. It's likely used to hold the object or entity that is being limited.\n\n- `Limit`, `Current`, and `Attempted`: These fields are of type `Amount` (which is not defined in the provided code snippet). They presumably represent the limit that has been set, the current amount or usage, and the amount that was attempted to be used when the limit was exceeded, respectively.\n\nThe `ExceededError` struct doesn't appear to use any specific algorithm. It's a data structure used to hold information about an error condition, specifically when a limit has been exceeded.\n\nThe code follows Go best practices for error handling, which recommends defining custom error types for different error conditions. This allows for more informative error messages and makes it easier to handle specific error conditions in the code. \n\nAs per architectural guidelines, the code appears to be well-structured and follows Go best practices. It does not seem to conflict with any standard architectural guidelines."

The function `Exceeded` returns an error of type `ExceededError` when a limit is exceeded. Here's a breakdown of the function:\n\n- The function `Exceeded` takes five parameters:\n  - `limiter`: This could be any type of object that is enforcing a limit.\n  - `limited`: This could be any type of object that is being limited.\n  - `limit`: This is the maximum limit or the threshold that should not be exceeded.\n  - `current`: This is the current value or state.\n  - `attempted`: This is the value that was attempted to be set or added.\n\n- The function uses `gomerr.Build` to create a new error of type `ExceededError`. The `gomerr` package is a Go package for creating and handling errors. The `Build` function in `gomerr` is used to construct an error object. The parameters passed to the `Build` function are used to initialize the `ExceededError` object.\n\n- The function returns the newly created `ExceededError` object.\n\nThis code does not seem to use any specific algorithms. However, it uses the Go error handling mechanism and the `gomerr` package for creating custom errors.\n\nAs for architectural guidelines, this code appears to be well-structured and follows good practices for error handling in Go. It encapsulates the creation of a specific type of error (`ExceededError`) in a separate function, which improves modularity and reusability of the code.\n\nFor more information on error handling in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)\n- [Go by Example: Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)\n- [Go error handling best practices](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-handle-errors-in-go)\n\nNote: There isn't much information available online about the `gomerr` package.

The function is named `UnquantifiedExcess` and it takes two parameters, `limiter` and `limited`, both of any type (`interface{}`). The function returns a pointer to an `ExceededError` object.\n\nThe function uses the `gomerr.Build` method to create a new error object. `gomerr` is a package in Go for creating and handling errors. The `Build` method is used to construct an error with additional context or properties. In this case, the `Build` method is being used to create a new `ExceededError` object.\n\nThe `Build` method takes several parameters. The first parameter is a new `ExceededError` object, created using `new(ExceededError)`. The `new` keyword in Go is used to allocate memory for a new object of the specified type. In this case, it is allocating memory for a new `ExceededError` object.\n\nThe next three parameters to the `Build` method are `limiter`, `limited`, and three `Unknown` values. These parameters are used to provide additional context or properties to the error being built. The purpose of these parameters would be clearer with more context about the `ExceededError` type and the `gomerr` package.\n\nFinally, the result of the `Build` method is type asserted to an `ExceededError` pointer using `.(*ExceededError)`. Type assertion in Go is a way to extract the underlying value of an interface. In this case, it is used to extract the `ExceededError` object from the result of the `Build` method.\n\nIn summary, this function creates a new `ExceededError` object with some context or properties, and returns it.\n\nFor more information about error handling in Go, you can refer to the [official Go blog on error handling](https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors).\n\nFor more information about the `gomerr` package, you can refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BlueBasher/gomerr). Please note that this is a third-party package and is not part of the standard Go library."
