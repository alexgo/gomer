This package seems to be focused on limiting some resource or functionality in a system, possibly related to rate limiting or resource allocation. \n\nThe code imports a package called \"gomerr\" from \"github.com/jt0/gomer\". Gomerr is a Go package that provides enhanced error handling capabilities for Go applications. It allows for the creation and propagation of errors with additional context, which can be useful for debugging and error tracking.\n\nThe main part of this snippet is the definition of an interface named \"Limited\". An interface in Go is a type that defines a set of methods that a type must have in order to implement the interface. In this case, the \"Limited\" interface defines three methods:\n\n1. `Limiter() (Limiter, gomerr.Gomerr)`: This method should return an instance of a type that implements the \"Limiter\" interface and a Gomerr error. The \"Limiter\" interface is not defined in this snippet, so we can't say exactly what it does, but given the name, it likely provides methods for applying and managing limits.\n\n2. `DefaultLimit() Amount`: This method should return the default limit as an \"Amount\". The \"Amount\" type is not defined in this snippet, but it is likely a numeric type that represents the quantity of some resource that can be used.\n\n3. `LimitAmount() Amount`: This method should return the current limit amount as an \"Amount\". This might be different from the default limit if, for example, the limit has been temporarily reduced due to high system load.\n\nThis interface would be used to abstract away the details of how limits are applied and managed. Any type that needs to have a limit applied to it would implement this interface, and other parts of the system could then interact with those types in a generic way using this interface.\n\nHere are some resources for further learning:\n\n- [Go Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces): This is a short tutorial on how to define and use interfaces in Go.\n- [Error handling in Go](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go): This is a blog post from the official Go blog that explains how error handling works in Go. \n- [Gomerr GitHub](https://github.com/jt0/gomer): This is the GitHub repository for the Gomerr package, where you can find more information about how it works and how to use it."

An interface in Go is a custom type that is used to specify a contract (behavior) that types should have. They are abstract, so they don't have an explicit implementation, they only define the methods that a type should possess.\n\nThe `Limiter` interface defines the following methods:\n\n1. `Dirtyable`: This seems to be another interface that this `Limiter` interface embeds. The methods defined in the `Dirtyable` interface will also be a part of the `Limiter` interface. The details of this interface are not provided in the code snippet.\n\n2. `Current(limited Limited) Amount`: This method takes an argument of type `Limited` and returns an `Amount`. The `Limited` and `Amount` could be any type (built-in or user-defined). The exact functionality of this method would depend on how it is implemented in the concrete type that satisfies the `Limiter` interface.\n\n3. `SetCurrent(limited Limited, current Amount)`: This method takes two arguments, one of type `Limited` and another of type `Amount`. The functionality of this method would be to set the current amount of something that is limited. The exact details would depend on the implementation in the concrete type.\n\n4. `Override(limited Limited) Amount` and `SetOverride(limited Limited, override Amount)`: These methods seem to get and set an override amount for something that is limited.\n\n5. `Maximum(limited Limited) Amount`: This method would return the maximum amount for something that is limited.\n\nThis interface could be used to implement any kind of limiting functionality, like rate limiting or resource limiting, in a software application. The exact details would depend on how these methods are implemented in the concrete types that satisfy this interface.\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since none are provided, we can only say that this code follows the general Go best practices for defining interfaces.\n\nFor more information on interfaces in Go, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [A Tour of Go: Interfaces](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9)"

It is a way to define and group related behavior. An interface is defined with the `type` keyword, followed by the name of the interface and the keyword `interface`. Inside the curly brackets `{}` we define a list of methods that the interface includes.\n\nThe `Dirtyable` interface in this code includes two methods: `IsDirty() bool` and `ClearDirty()`. Any type that defines these two methods is said to implement the `Dirtyable` interface.\n\n- `IsDirty() bool`: This method returns a boolean value. It is expected to be implemented by a type to indicate if the object is \"dirty\" or not. In a software context, an object is often marked as \"dirty\" if it has been modified since it was last saved or synchronized.\n\n- `ClearDirty()`: This method does not return a value. It is expected to be implemented by a type to clear the \"dirty\" status of the object, often indicating that the object has been saved or synchronized.\n\nThis interface could be used in a variety of contexts, but it's often used in software patterns that involve tracking the state of objects, such as the \"dirty checking\" pattern. This pattern is common in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) systems, graphic libraries, or any context where it's important to track if an object has changed.\n\nHere are some resources for further reading:\n- [Go by Example: Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)\n- [Effective Go: Interfaces](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#interfaces)\n- [Go Interfaces Tutorial](https://www.callicoder.com/golang-interfaces/)"
